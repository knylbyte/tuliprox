//! One shape for "fetch this input's playlist", whatever kind of provider it is.
//!
//! The three provider families in this crate were modelled three different ways — M3U as
//! free functions, Xtream as free functions with a different arity, Stalker as a struct
//! client whose orchestration lives in `tuliprox-processing` — and each returned a
//! differently-shaped tuple. The dispatcher paid for that: a ninety-line `match` whose
//! arms each hand-assembled a six-element tuple, padding the fields their provider did not
//! produce with literal zeros and `false`s, and then destructured the lot positionally.
//! Two of those six elements were dead on arrival.
//!
//! [`PlaylistFetch`] is that result with names, and [`PlaylistProvider`] is the one method
//! every family can implement. Providers are constructed per-input with whatever they
//! individually need — an event sink, a refresh mode — so `fetch` takes only what all of
//! them take.
//!
//! Dispatch stays a `match` and stays statically dispatched: the win is that each arm now
//! names one type instead of assembling a tuple by position.
