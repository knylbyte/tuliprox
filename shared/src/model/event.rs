//! The in-process event taxonomy.
//!
//! `EventMessage` used to live in `tuliprox-session`, which meant that
//! `metadata`, `dvr` and `processing` all had to depend on the *streaming
//! session runtime* just to name an event. A metadata refresh has nothing
//! to do with provider allocation, so the type lives here instead: `shared`
//! is the one crate every emitter already sees.
//!
//! The bus implementation (`EventManager`) stays in `session`, where the
