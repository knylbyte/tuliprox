# Changelog

## Unreleased

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Smart EPG normalization now preserves XMLTV ID separators by default.** The default `normalize_regex` changed from
  `[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]` to `[^a-zA-Z0-9._\-]`. Existing configurations that explicitly set the former pattern keep the
  legacy separator-removal behavior; remove the override or use the new pattern to adopt the new default.

- **STRM names now use the processed target title by default**: Previously, STRM folders and filenames preferred the
  media metadata name. Existing STRM targets that must retain that behavior need `use_metadata: true`; otherwise the
  next export can generate different paths, and `cleanup: true` can remove the old files.

- **Shared Input Skip Option Names**:
  - Input options now serialize as `skip_live`, `skip_vod`, and `skip_series` instead of the old
    type-prefixed `xtream_skip_*` / `stalker_skip_*` names.
  - Existing config files remain read-compatible because the old names are still accepted as aliases.
  - This is still a breaking change for generated config, API payloads, docs snippets, and any tooling that depends on
    the old serialized field names.
- **Staged inputs reworked into a first-class `staged` input type.** The old nested `staged:` block on
  provider inputs (with `enabled`, `live_source`, `vod_source`, and `series_source`) has been removed.
  A staged source is now its own input with `type: staged`. It points to one non-staged `m3u` /
  `xtream` provider through `staged.for_input`, and `staged.clusters` selects which clusters (`live`,
  `vod`, `series`) are loaded from the staged playlist. Clusters not selected there are loaded from the
  provider input itself. The merged result is stored under the provider input, so playlist delivery and
  stream/API routing continue to use the provider.

  Before:

  ```yaml
  inputs:
    - name: provider_a
      type: xtream
      url: http://provider-a.tv/player_api.php
      username: alice
      password: secret
      staged:
        url: http://lists.example/list1.m3u
        type: m3u
        live_source: staged
  ```

  After:

  ```yaml
  inputs:
    - name: provider_a
      type: xtream
      url: http://provider-a.tv/player_api.php
      username: alice
      password: secret
    - name: provider_a_list
      type: staged
      url: http://lists.example/list1.m3u
      staged:
        provider: provider_a
        clusters: [live]
  ```

  A staged input cannot be linked directly to a target. It must reference an existing non-staged `m3u` /
  `xtream` provider input, and each provider can have at most one staged overlay. Staged inputs do not
  use `priority`, `max_connections`, or `cache_duration`; the linked provider controls stream limits and
  refresh cadence.

- **Case-insensitive EPG channel-id matching**: EPG channel-id matching is now case-insensitive (ASCII). Ids are no
  longer lowercased when parsed — output preserves the source's original case. Users whose sources provide MixedCase
  ids will see MixedCase ids in the M3U/XMLTV output instead of the previously-lowercased form; downstream players may
  re-map affected channels once. Supersedes #688 (M3U tvg-id lowercasing removed).

- Removed the `plex` STRM export style. Existing STRM outputs configured with `style: plex` must switch to `kodi`,
  `emby`, or `jellyfin`; Plex use cases should use the HDHomeRun integration instead. Existing generated TMDB marker
  paths remain read-compatible, but `style: plex` is no longer accepted in configuration.

- **`web_ui.auth.token_ttl_mins: 0` no longer means "never expire".** A configured `0` used to mint tokens with a
  ~100-year lifetime — a permanent bearer credential written as if it were a configuration convenience. `0` now falls
  back to the 24-hour default, and anything above the 30-day ceiling (`43200` minutes) is clamped; both log a warning
  naming the effective lifetime. Deployments that relied on `0` for long-lived tokens must set an explicit value within
  the ceiling, and their clients will start re-authenticating.

- **A missing, malformed or wrong-scheme `Authorization` header now answers `401`, not `403`.** The auth extractors all
  returned `403 Forbidden` for a request that never authenticated at all, and sent no `WWW-Authenticate` challenge — so
  a `401` from this server was never a well-formed `401`. Responses now carry the challenge for the scheme the endpoint
  wanted. Only an unresolvable peer address stays a `400`. Clients that branch on `403` to mean "not signed in" need to
  handle `401`.

- **Notification event ids replace `MsgKind`.** `messaging.notify_on` is now a list of glob patterns over dotted
  `domain.event` ids — `*`, `recording.*`, `provider.*.expired`, and a leading `!` to exclude, so
  `["*", "!system.info"]` reads the way it looks. Every legacy `MsgKind` name (`info`, `stats`, `disk_alert`, …) is
  still accepted and resolves to its canonical id, but the config is **rewritten in canonical form the next time it is
  saved**. Existing template filenames keep working; template maps are now keyed by event id wire name.

- **Secrets are masked in config API responses.** `GET` of the main config previously returned `config.yml` in full to
  any client holding `ConfigRead`, including the Telegram bot token, the Pushover token and user key, and any
  `Authorization` header configured on the REST channel. Those — plus the new ntfy token, Gotify token and REST signing
  secret — are now masked on the way out. A save restores any secret the client echoes back still masked, so a Web UI
  round-trip cannot overwrite a real token with the mask; a genuinely changed secret still writes through. Tooling that
  read provider credentials out of the config endpoint can no longer do so.

- **A failed local library scan is now `library.scan.failed`, not `library.scan.completed`.** The taxonomy mapped
  `LibraryScanProgress` to the completion id whatever the summary said, so the failure path reached operators as
  "A local library scan finished" at info severity. Failure now takes its own id at error severity, discriminated on
  the status the payload already carries. A `notify_on` glob such as `library.*` or `library.scan.*` picks the new id
  up; a subscription naming `library.scan.completed` exactly will stop being told about failed scans and needs the new
  id added.

## 🌟 New Features

- **Target-specific bouquet filters are now managed directly from the Source Editor.** Each target shows its current
  bouquet status below the regular filter settings and opens a full-size editor for selecting Live, VOD, and Series
  groups. Bouquet filters support both whitelist and blacklist mode, are stored by the target's unique name, and take
  effect on the next playlist update. Leaving every cluster unselected means no bouquet restriction; an individual
  cluster may intentionally have no selected groups while another cluster remains configured.

- **Target filters can run during processing or immediately before persistence.** The existing scalar `filter` syntax
  remains the `processing` stage. The staged map accepts optional `processing` and `persist` filters; `persist` sees
  the fully finalized state after EPG processing, mappings, merge, deduplication, sorting, numbering, and counters.
  Omitting `processing` no longer requires a match-all filter, and targets may omit `filter` entirely. Presence checks
  use `IS EMPTY` / `IS NOT EMPTY`; `= EMPTY` / `!= EMPTY` remain accepted as compact aliases.

- **Targets can clear invalid EPG IDs without removing playlist entries.** Setting
  `options.clear_invalid_epg_ids: true` clears IDs that do not resolve to processed EPG data, including IDs changed by
  mappings. Without the option, unmatched IDs are preserved. The old `required_epg` name remains a read-only alias.

- **Ten events for the failures that used to be silent**: the registry described states nothing emitted, and several
  subsystems reported their start and their success but never their own failure. The taxonomy is now 42 events (up
  from 32) and gains two domains, `scheduled_task.*` and `notification.*`.
  - **`system.started` / `system.shutdown`** had been registered — and documented — since the registry was written,
    with nothing in the tree emitting either, so an operator who subscribed got silence. One payload carries both
    kinds, so a subscriber can ask for restarts alone: the running version and the bound address on start, the signal
    name on stop. Placement is the whole design: the start event is published *after* the notification bridge
    subscribes, because anything published before it reaches nobody, and the stop event *before* the service tokens are
    cancelled, because that stops the outbox that would carry it. Neither reaches the WebSocket — there is no panel
    that renders them, and the Web UI has necessarily disconnected by the time the second one fires.
  - **`provider.fetch.failed`** reports what kind of fetch failure it was. `ProviderErrorKind` already classified every
    provider failure across all three families and already exposed `is_retryable()` and `needs_operator()` — the two
    questions an operator actually asks — and nothing consumed either, so every fetch failure was counted, logged and
    treated identically. The event carries the classification, the worst error's text, how many there were, and whether
    any of the playlist came through anyway. Severity follows the classification rather than the registry: a `Config`
    failure will not fix itself and is an error, everything else may and is a warning. Input name and error text go
    through `sanitize_sensitive_info`, since both can carry a provider URL with credentials in it.
  - **`provider.pool.exhausted` and `provider.priority.fallback`** — two moments the lineup manager knew about and told
    nobody. `ActiveProvider` reported that connection counts moved; nothing reported that a stream was *refused*
    because every provider behind the input was full. The per-provider current/max-plus-expiry snapshot that
    `log_exhausted_pool_snapshot` built and then discarded unless debug logging happened to be on is now built
    unconditionally on that (already slow) path, and the debug line and the event render from the same structured data.
    Priority fallback — `acquire` walking priority groups high to low and silently falling through when the preferred
    ones are at capacity — is reported on transition rather than per allocation, because the fall-through happens on
    every request while the primary is full and one event per stream start would bury the thing worth hearing; a move
    back towards group zero is a recovery and says so. Input and provider names are sanitized.
  - **`user.connection.denied`**: `ActiveUser` reports connects and disconnects, and a refusal is neither, so the one
    outcome a user actually complains about was the one nothing published — the admission ladder modelled it fully and
    handed it to the caller and nobody else. It carries the user, the address the request was attributed to, and the
    limit that was reached, and it takes `UserRead` rather than the system-wide read: "who was turned away" is the same
    question as "who signed in". Only the strategy path emits; an explicit `Terminate` also resolves to exhausted, but
    that is a requested teardown, not a denial.
  - **`playlist.watch.disabled` / `playlist.watch.unmatched`**: `watch` had one event for everything it knows and three
    ways to stop working without saying so — every pattern failing to compile, which disabled the feature on a typo
    behind a single `warn!`; the target carrying the reserved default name; and a watch state file that could not be
    read or written, which either re-baselined the group (losing the change it should have reported) or dropped it
    entirely. All three now report the reason and, where there is one, the underlying error. The first needed the config
    layer to stop discarding the distinction: an empty `Some` is now load-bearing and means "configured and unusable",
    which is not the same as "not configured". `playlist.watch.unmatched` covers the fourth silence — a pattern matching
    no group looks exactly like a group that has not changed, so a typo in `watch` was invisible.
  - **`playlist.groups.changed`**: `watch` tracked channels inside named groups and was blind to the group set itself,
    in both directions. A group appearing was silent — no baseline file, so one was written, nothing was emitted, and
    the group's entire channel list read as "not new" from then on — and a group vanishing was worse, since it is absent
    from the refreshed playlist and no code path observed the disappearance at all. The target's group titles are now
    diffed against a persisted index before the per-group fan-out, so it sees every group rather than only the ones the
    watch patterns name; the question is which groups exist, not what is inside the watched ones. The index sits beside
    the per-group directory (`<target>.groups.bin`, not `<target>/__groups.bin`) so it cannot collide with a group whose
    sanitized title matches, and first sight writes the baseline silently — announcing every existing group as new on
    the first refresh after an upgrade would be noise. Gated on `target.watch` being configured, so it costs nothing for
    targets that never asked to be watched.
  - **`metadata.update.failed` for an input whose tasks burn through their retries**: the completion event only fires
    when a cycle drains *with changes*, and an exhausted task only reached a `debug!`, so an input whose resolves fail
    every time emitted a start and then nothing for as long as it stayed broken — on the bus, indistinguishable from one
    still working through a long queue. The worker now counts the tasks that exhaust their retries during a cycle and
    reports the input, the count, whether anything resolved anyway, and the last error. Reported alongside the
    completion rather than instead of it: a cycle can both produce changes and exhaust tasks, and the completion is what
    triggers the downstream playlist update. Per cycle rather than per task, since a provider that has stopped answering
    fails every item behind it.
  - **`scheduled_task.failed`**: the playlist update and the library scan report their own outcomes, but the GeoIP
    refresh had no terminal event of its own — it logged one line and moved on — so an operator running on a stale
    database never found out. It carries the task type and the cron expression that triggered it. The task is typed as
    `ScheduleTaskType` rather than a free string, so a task added to that enum cannot be reported under a name nothing
    recognises. A disabled GeoIP update stays silent: the task ran and correctly found nothing to do, which is not a
    failure.
  - **`notification.dead_lettered`** was registered and documented; the outbox detected the condition, bumped
    `health().dead_lettered` and logged to `notification::audit`, and nothing subscribing to the bus could learn that a
    notification had been permanently lost. It is now emitted at the point the outbox gives up, carrying the event id,
    the attempt count, the channels that never accepted it, and when it was first enqueued. It is deliberately *not*
    notifiable and deliberately absent from `NOTIFIABLE_KINDS`, so the bridge is not even woken for it: this event
    exists because delivery failed, and enqueueing a notice about it into the same outbox against the same channels that
    just failed is the loop its registry entry warns about. Operators still get the audit line and the counter, and
    plugins see it on the bus. Emitted at the attempts-exhausted site only — a notification every channel rejects as
    permanent is also dropped, but that path cannot yet be told apart from a clean delivery.
  - **`library.scan.failed`** — see Breaking Changes. `EventKind` gains it alongside the progress kind rather than
    reusing it: progress is high-frequency and a scan failure is not, so a subscriber that only wants failures should
    not have to take the tick firehose to get them.

- **Open-world notification system**: adding a notification channel or a notification event is no longer a change
  across ten sites in three crates.
  - **Events are ids, not an enum.** An event is a dotted `domain.event` string with a registered severity and
    description. 42 events are registered today, spanning `system.*`, `playlist.*`, `recording.*`, `provider.*`,
    `config.*`, `library.*`, `metadata.*`, `user.*`, `auth.*`, `stream.*`, `scheduled_task.*` and `notification.*`. The
    Web UI event picker is driven by the registry, so an event added in the backend appears in the UI without a
    frontend change, and template discovery
    iterates the registry instead of a hardcoded eight-variant list that silently made new kinds undiscoverable.
  - **Four new channels**: `ntfy` (self-hosted push, no account or bot token), `gotify`, `slack` (real Block Kit
    header/section/context blocks rather than a re-used Discord embed), and `command`, which runs a local program with
    the event JSON on stdin. The command channel executes the binary directly rather than through a shell, so there are
    no quoting rules and no shell-injection surface from event content; a missing binary is a permanent failure, while a
    non-zero exit or timeout is retried.
  - **Webhook HMAC signing**: the REST channel takes an optional `signing_secret` and sends an HMAC-SHA256 of
    `{timestamp}.{body}` as `X-Tuliprox-Signature`. The timestamp is inside the signed payload, so a captured request
    cannot be replayed with a fresh header. Verified against the RFC 4231 test vector.
  - **Per-channel routing**: each channel accepts an optional `routing` block (`notify_on`, `min_severity`,
    `quiet_hours`, `max_per_hour`, `dedup_window_secs`), so "critical to Pushover, everything to Discord" is now
    expressible. An absent block inherits the global subscription, so existing configs are unaffected. Quiet hours
    **defer** rather than drop — an overnight outage nobody hears about afterwards is worse than one that arrives late —
    and the hourly ceiling emits one "further notifications suppressed" line when it trips so the silence is
    distinguishable from a dead notifier.
  - **Durable delivery for every notification.** The outbox moved out of the recording supervisor, is no longer gated on
    the recording config, and starts unconditionally once the listener is bound. Playlist stats, watch changes, disk
    alerts and provider warnings previously fanned out and discarded every outcome, so a transient `502` lost them
    permanently. Entries key pending channels by stable string id, so an outbox written by a build that knows a newer
    channel no longer fails to deserialize and take every pending notification down with it. Entries left in
    `recording_notification_outbox.json` are adopted into `notification_outbox.json` exactly once.
  - **Failures are classified.** `408`/`429`/`5xx` are transient; other `4xx` are permanent and dead-letter immediately
    instead of burning every attempt on a request that will fail identically forever. A provider's `Retry-After` — both
    legal header forms, with a past HTTP-date clamped to "retry now" — wins over our own backoff rather than retrying
    straight back into the rate limit.
  - **Every event renders on every channel.** One notification envelope carries id, severity, timestamp, instance, dedup
    key, title, body and the typed payload, with `title` and `body` always populated. Pushover gains template support,
    sends `title` separately and maps severity onto its own priority scale — it previously pushed raw `serde_json` dumps
    of watch changes and playlist stats to phones. Every channel's severity maps onto the target's own priority scale
    rather than being dropped.
  - **A test endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/config/messaging/test` renders and optionally sends a chosen event to a chosen
    channel and returns the per-channel outcome *and* the exact rendered body. `preview: true` renders without sending,
    so a template can be iterated without spamming a channel. It deliberately bypasses `notify_on` and the suppression
    window — the operator asked for this one explicitly.
  - **Typed provider account events**: `provider.account.status_changed`, `.expiring` and `.expired` replace account
    status and expiry warnings that previously landed in the generic info/error buckets, so subscribing to "my account
    is about to expire" no longer means also receiving every processing error. All three carry a dedup key, since they
    are re-evaluated on every playlist refresh.
  - Section 5 of the operator documentation is rewritten for this model: the glob grammar, a table of all registered
    events with their default severities (checked against the registry by a test in both directions), per-channel
    routing, delivery semantics, the new channels, and the uniform `event.*` template context alongside every legacy
    key. The table sits between generated-block markers and is checked against the registry by a test in both
    directions, so a registered event missing from the table — or a table row for an event that no longer exists — is a
    test failure rather than stale documentation.

- **Event bus as the single event backbone**: the WebSocket bus and the notification layer used to be two disconnected
  worlds with their own emitters. They are now one taxonomy that plugins, notifications and the Web UI all read.
  - The notification pipeline subscribes to the bus, so every bus event — playlist updates, config changes, library
    scans, user connections, metadata updates, recording changes — can be notified on, and every future event comes
    along with it. Everything defaults to unsubscribed, so an upgrade does not start messaging anyone until `notify_on`
    asks for it. High-frequency variants (progress ticks, download deltas, periodic system info) are deliberately not
    notifiable; their terminal counterparts are what get through.
  - Nine notification-only lifecycle events moved onto the bus (disk alerts, config reload failures, playlist watch
    changes, the three recording lifecycle events, and the three provider account events), so they now reach plugins and
    subscribers rather than only operators on mail.
  - **New events**: `user.created` / `.updated` / `.deleted` for API-proxy user CRUD, `stream.probe.failed` for ffprobe
    failures, `config.reload_failed`, and the auth audit events below. User events carry username, target and state —
    never the password or token; probe failures carry a sanitized URL and are deduplicated per input, so a provider
    outage notifies once instead of once per channel behind it.
  - **`GET /api/v1/events/stats`** (behind `system.read`, like `/status`) reports the bus counters — emissions per kind,
    emissions with no subscriber, and the size of every gap a lagging subscriber was told about — plus a 256-entry ring
    of recent events with their kind, uptime and outcome, including the ones that were coalesced. "Why did my
    notification not fire?" was otherwise unanswerable without a debug build.
  - **State snapshots on connect**: events that describe current state rather than an occurrence (the system-info and
    downloads samples) are retained, so a Web UI session that connects between samples gets them immediately instead of
    showing empty panels for up to three seconds. Occurrences are never replayed.
  - **Graceful shutdown**: the stream-meter registry is flushed at shutdown, so a stream still running when the server
    stops no longer loses its last window's transferred bytes.
  - **Plugin subscription seam**: a plugin manifest's `events.*` list resolves to a subscription mask, with unknown names
    reported rather than silently narrowing what the plugin asked for, and every event defines its own JSON payload.

- **Authentication hardening**: sign-in throttling, token revocation, and an audit trail.
  - **Login throttling**: `/auth/token` used to verify an argon2 hash, answer `401` and forget, so a password list could
    be worked against it as fast as the hash function allows. Failures are now counted on two dimensions — client
    address, which stops one host grinding a list, and username, which stops a distributed attack converging on one
    account. Three free attempts, then 2s doubling to a 15-minute ceiling, answered as `429` with `Retry-After`. The
    check runs *before* the argon2 verify, and a correct password clears the block immediately. Usernames are
    canonicalised the way the rest of the auth path compares them, so `Alice` and `alice` share one budget.
  - **Token revocation**: the tokens this server mints are stateless JWTs, so a leaked one previously stayed valid until
    it expired — there was no way to end a session or respond to a compromise short of rotating the signing secret,
    which kills every session at once. `POST /auth/revoke/{username}` ends one principal's sessions across both identity
    namespaces and `POST /auth/revoke` ends everyone's; both require `UserWrite`. Revocation is a per-subject watermark
    ("everything issued at or before this instant is dead") rather than a deny-list, so it is bounded in size and can
    express "sign out everywhere" and "revoke everything issued before the breach". It is persisted — a revocation that
    stopped applying at the next restart would be a security control in name only — and a revocation file that will not
    parse is a startup error rather than an empty store. The refresh endpoint checks revocation too.
  - **Auth audit events**: sign-ins, rejected sign-ins, throttled sign-ins and permission denials reach the bus as
    `auth.sign_in.succeeded` / `.failed` / `.throttled` and `auth.permission.denied` — previously they went to a log line
    and nowhere else, so the events that matter most for spotting an intrusion were the ones nothing could subscribe to.
    Each is a separate event id, so a subscriber can ask for the failures without being woken by every successful
    sign-in. The record holds a username, an address and an outcome; the password and the token are not in the type at
    all rather than being redacted at each render site, because these records reach Telegram, webhooks and shell
    commands. Notifications dedupe per principal, address and outcome, so a password-guessing run is one piece of news
    rather than one per attempt. They require `UserRead`, not `SystemRead`, and are not pushed to the Web UI socket.

- **Providers remember what they already told us**: Stalker capability knowledge — whether a portal implements
  `get_all_channels`, which handshake recipe worked, which of several endpoint candidates answered — was discovered and
  then thrown away, so every refresh re-probed endpoints already known to `404` and replayed a chain whose answer was
  known. Replaying a full handshake chain against a portal with stale credentials looks, from the provider's side, a lot
  like credential stuffing. The snapshot is a hint rather than a contract: every claim carries the instant it was
  observed and expires after a day, a remembered endpoint is moved to the front of the candidate list rather than
  replacing it, and a clock that has run backwards leaves the snapshot alone. A JSON-file store (one file per input,
  written through the workspace atomic-write helper, ignoring a corrupt file rather than failing) is included for
  persisting it across restarts; the composition root does not load or write it yet, so today the memory lasts for the
  life of a client.

- **Streaming provider catalogs**: `get_live_streams` and friends buffered an entire provider catalog into memory before
  the caller saw a single row. They now have a streaming variant that hands over batches as they arrive, matching the
  shape the bulk-EPG path already had. The trade is made explicit rather than hidden: the accumulating sink can still
  restart pagination on the next endpoint candidate after a mid-catalog failure (which is why a truncated catalog is
  never returned as success), while the streaming sink reports that it can no longer restart once a page has been
  released, and an error there means the delivered batches are an incomplete prefix.

- **DVR Feature**: a full digital video recorder built around a queue-mutation boundary with a typed `QueueMutationError`,
  atomic edit/quota rollback, O(1) edit writes via a remembered `RecordingLocation`, server-side conflict preview
  (`POST /api/v1/recording/conflicts/preview`), and a `ConflictSeverity` of `NoKnownConflict` / `PossibleCapacityWait` /
  `LikelyMissedWindow`. Three background supervisors start once the HTTP listener is bound, honour the `downloads`
  cancellation token, and re-read their config each tick so a reload applies without a restart:
  - **Startup reconciliation** finishes or undoes deletions interrupted by a crash (tasks whose
    `recording.deleting_previous_state` was set), and repairs queue/rule-store drift.
  - **Retention** performs the age, count, and disk-watermark sweeps described in the operator guide
    (`tuliprox/docs/src/operator/dvr.md`).
  - **Notification outbox** delivers lifecycle notifications durably, retrying **per channel** with capped exponential
    backoff and dead-lettering after `max_attempts`. A notification that reached Telegram but not Discord is retried
    only against Discord, so retries stay compatible with the at-most-once contract.
  - `GET /api/v1/recording/health` (administrator only) reports each supervisor's last-tick timestamp, the outbox
    depth, and the dead-letter count.

  Two WebSocket notifications carry the recording subsystem: `RecordingChanged` (any queue mutation) and
  `RecordingRulesChanged` (rule-store mutation). The cancel-recording-task endpoint emits both because cancelling
  future rule recordings mutates the queue as well as the rule store.

  Authorization is gated by `Claims::is_system_principal`, which now requires both `username == "recording-supervisor"`
  *and* `subject_id.is_builtin_admin()` so a web user registered with the sentinel name cannot forge the system bypass;
  the supervisor is the only path that mints both.

  Media opens for catalog, range, full-body, thumbnail and subtitle flows go through `no_follow_path_in_root`, which
  walks every component from `recording_root` to the leaf with `symlink_metadata`. A symlink at any intermediate path
  such as `<root>/users/alice` is rejected before `File::open` follows it, closing the `<recording_root>/users/alice -> /etc`
  containment bypass.

  `bin/dvr_doctor.sh` exposes supervisor health, the effective recording config block, the quota ledger and on-disk
  state as one read-only dump suitable for a support ticket.

- **Automatic Xtream Account Expiration Refresh**:
  - Server mode now refreshes missing or soon-expiring Xtream `exp_date` values directly through each account's
    `player_api.php` credentials, independently of playlist updates and reseller Panel API provisioning.
  - Per-account daily checks, five-minute panel-wide spacing across aliases, and a six-hour panel cooldown after
    transport, HTTP 403/429, or server failures reduce the risk of provider bans.
  - Updates are persisted in 15-minute batches to source YAML and Xtream alias CSV files, with timestamped backups,
    atomic writes, durable throttle state, and a single in-memory config refresh per batch.
  - Accounts reported as expired are persisted and disabled immediately; Tuliprox does not re-enable them
    automatically.

- **QoS snapshot compaction**: `qos_aggregation.compaction_interval_secs` now periodically rebuilds
  `qos_snapshot.db` to reclaim storage from expired snapshots. It defaults to daily; set it to `0` to disable
  automatic compaction without changing QoS summary windows.

- **STRM metadata naming option**: STRM outputs now accept `use_metadata: true` to prefer media metadata names for
  generated folders and filenames. The default remains the target's processed title, so title rename and mapping rules
  apply to STRM paths without additional configuration.

- **Mapping block `stage` (`processing` / `after_epg`)**:
  - Each `mapping.yml` block now accepts an optional `stage`. The default `processing` keeps the block at the
    target's `M` slot; `after_epg` runs once EPG channel IDs and logos are enriched so mappers can react to
    them. Counters still run after the final merge and sort. The shared `MappingStage` enum rejects unknown
    values, and the directory merge fails configuration loading when one mapping id uses conflicting stages.
  - Mapping-directory merges now preserve declaration order and the first block's `match_as_ascii` value.

- **Mapper Read-Only Metadata Fields**:
  - Mapper scripts can read `@Input` and `@Type` directly and use them as regex sources or map keys.
  - Assignments to these immutable fields are rejected while all existing read-write fields remain assignable.

- **Dependency-aware parallel playlist updates**:
  - `process_parallel: true` now downloads independent inputs concurrently and starts each source's targets as soon as
    its required inputs are ready.
  - Added optional non-zero `inputs[].sequential_group` IDs to serialize complete refreshes that share provider
    credentials or another upstream ban constraint.
  - Target preparation remains configuration-ordered, while final persistence overlaps only for disjoint normalized
    storage, M3U, and STRM paths.
  - Stalker Live/VOD/Series/EPG selections publish atomically and resume a durable completion checkpoint after a crash.
  - Playlist update progress messages identify the affected input.

- **New Stalker Portal Integration**:
  - Added first-class Stalker input support to Tuliprox.
  - Added Stalker catalog preview support in the protected Web UI playlist endpoints.
  - Added Stalker playback URL materialization with runtime `create_link` refresh for stale or expired temp links.
  - Added typed handling for portal-internal auth/session body codes such as `44` and `440..449` so Stalker playback refresh can react to them.
  - Added Stalker bulk-EPG ingestion with streaming parse and batched persistence to avoid buffering the full payload in memory first.
  - Added explicit unresolved-item semantics for Stalker playlist entries: Tuliprox keeps Stalker playback metadata without
    exposing raw portal `cmd` values as playlist URLs.
  - Added follow-up hardening for Stalker temp-link playback modes, runtime stale-URL invalidation, endpoint-preference ordering,
    and soft session-TTL refresh behavior.
  - Added explicit Stalker transport-policy handling: Tuliprox only proxies `http`/`https` playback URLs and rejects unsupported `rtmp`/`rtsp`
    commands up front.
  - Added the remaining Stalker config fields to the Web UI, including device identity overrides and per-action response-size caps.
  - The remaining open edge case is portal-specific header/cookie forwarding for temp-link media requests; fresh temp-link resolution
    itself is already implemented.

- **Shared HLS stale-origin recovery and finite terminal tails**:
  - Detects reachable-but-stale HTTP `200` origins from host/epoch-local progress evidence and retains the complete
    configured acceptance burst, including all derived `beast` lanes and slots.
  - Uses lease-specific READY reserve, measured playback position, recovery ETA, and transition margin for admission,
    recovery, and cutover; publication lateness and request counters no longer terminalize playback.
  - Validates critical MPEG-TS handoffs with bounded read-only `mpeg2ts-reader` inspection without modifying origin,
    candidate, or cached media.
  - Prepares twelve finite terminal TS blocks ahead of cutover with target-duration timestamp stride and measured asset
    duration, then serves compatible warm terminal manifests as HTTP `200` with discontinuity, optional key reset, and
    `#EXT-X-ENDLIST` on lease- and generation-bound routes.
  - Adds bounded autonomous terminal-commit retries, sticky terminal leases, GC protection for referenced live tails,
    and operational alert/rollout guidance for probe, bundle, recovery-deadline, and commit-retry failures.

- **ICS Calendar EPG Sources**: Import iCalendar (`.ics`) events as XMLTV EPG data with M3U and Xtream channel
  assignment, Smart Match support, configurable four-hour dummy gap filling, bounded atomic cache downloads, and
  aggregated warnings for recurring events that are detected but not expanded yet.

- **Extended EPG Programme Metadata**:
  - XMLTV imports now preserve all programme `<category>` elements, including optional `lang` attributes, as well as
    the presence of `<live/>` and `<new/>` tags.
  - The metadata is retained while merging EPG sources, persisted for M3U and Xtream targets, and included in served
    XMLTV output and Web UI EPG previews.
  - ICS `CATEGORIES` properties are converted into individual XMLTV categories, including repeated properties and
    escaped commas; ICS events do not infer `live` or `new` without an unambiguous source value.
  - Existing persisted EPG data remains readable and defaults the new metadata to empty categories and unset flags.

- **Trakt Charts**: Xtream Trakt integration can now build virtual categories from public Trakt charts via `trakt.charts[]`.
  - MVP supports `movies/shows` with `trending` and `popular`.
  - User-owned Trakt lists remain configured separately under `trakt.lists[]`.

- **Update Log In Playlist Update View**:
  - The Playlists → Update view now shows a terminal-style log that accumulates `PlaylistUpdateProgress` and
    `LibraryScanProgress` events in real time, prefixed with `[playlist]` / `[library]` and a local `HH:MM:SS`
    timestamp, with auto-scroll to the latest line and a FIFO cap of 500 entries.
  - The log is cleared synchronously when the user clicks either the playlist Update or the library Update button,
    so each run starts with a fresh view.
  - Styled to match the dark monospace look of a console (uses existing theme CSS variables for background, border,
    and text color) and honors the same touch / overflow behavior as the rest of the view.

- **Session Expiry Handling**:
  - The Web UI now schedules a client-side logout when the JWT expires, showing a notification and returning the
    user to the login screen instead of silently failing with 401 errors.

- **Guided Empty States**:
  - Empty lists now show a short hint explaining what to do next instead of just "No content",
    applied to HDHomeRun devices, schedules, the API proxy server list, the playlist explorer, and the EPG viewer.

- **Status Health Banner**:
  - A single green/amber/red health indicator in the header aggregates the realtime connection, backend status,
    and provider connection capacity, with a hover breakdown and click-through to the Stats view.
  - The banner now switches to amber ("degraded") only when **every** input group is exhausted. A busy provider
    with available fallback capacity (another enabled alias or input in the same group) stays green, matching
    the `/ready` endpoint. The per-provider 80% warning threshold still colors the individual provider rows in
    the hover breakdown.

- **Readiness Probe Endpoint (`/ready`)**:
  - New `GET /ready` endpoint for load balancers and container orchestration: answers `200`
    (`{"status":"ready"}`) while at least one input group has spare connection capacity, and `503`
    (`{"status":"exhausted"}`) once every input group is fully used. Before provider connections are
    registered it answers `503` (`{"status":"initializing"}`).
  - Capacity is evaluated per input group: an input and its enabled aliases form one group, so a saturated
    primary account still counts as ready while any of its aliases (or any other group) has a free slot.
    Disabled inputs and aliases contribute no capacity.
  - The container-template `docker-compose.yml` documents the probe split: Docker keeps the liveness check via
    `/healthcheck` (restarts on crash, not on transient capacity exhaustion), while orchestrators (k8s, swarm)
    should point their readiness probe at `/ready`. `/api/v1/status` remains the detailed status payload.

- **Live Metric Sparklines**:
  - The Stats cards now show interactive time-series sparklines for CPU, memory, network throughput, active users,
    and active user connections, keeping a rolling history so trends are visible at a glance.
  - Hovering shows a cursor and tooltip with the value at that point
  - System metrics are now sampled every 2 seconds (down from 5) for more responsive charts.

- **Bookmarkable Views (Deep Linking)**:
  - The active view is now reflected in the URL hash (e.g. `#stats`, `#source_editor`), so views can be bookmarked, shared,  
    and navigated directly via URL.
  - Browser back/forward navigation and manual hash edits now switch the active view accordingly.

- **Dev Container Support**:
  - Added a `.devcontainer` setup so the project can be developed in a reproducible container (locally, on a remote
    Docker host, or in Codespaces). It pins Rust 1.89.0, adds the WASM and musl targets, and installs `trunk`,
    `wasm-bindgen`, `cross`, `cargo-edit`, `mdbook`, and `markdownlint-cli2`, forwarding the backend (8901) and
    frontend dev-server (9899) ports.

- **UI Micro-Interactions**:
  - Cards now gently lift with a soft shadow on hover, buttons give a subtle press/ripple feedback when clicked,
    and collapse/accordion chevrons smoothly rotate between open and closed states. All effects honor
    `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

- **Animated Theme Transitions**:
  - Switching themes now cross-dissolves colors, backgrounds, borders, and shadows instead of snapping instantly.
    The transition is applied only during the switch (never during normal hover/interaction) and is fully disabled
    for users who set `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.

- **Resilient Sidebar Initialization**:
  - The sidebar no longer panics if the global `window` object is unavailable; resize handling and responsive
    collapse now degrade gracefully instead of crashing the app.

- **Improved Screen-Reader Support**:
  - Toast notifications are now announced by screen readers via an `aria-live` region (errors assertively, others
    politely).
  - The sidebar toggle button exposes its `aria-expanded` state and an accessible label, and the active navigation
    item is marked with `aria-current="page"`.

- **Table Empty-State Message**:
  - Paged/data tables now show a localized "No content" message in their empty state instead of just an icon,
    making it clearer when a query or filter returns no rows. (Table headers already stick to the top while scrolling.)

- **Debounced Filter Editor Input**:
  - Typing in the filter editor no longer re-parses and previews the filter on every keystroke; parsing and change
    notifications are now debounced, keeping the textarea responsive while editing large filters.

- **Persisted UI Preferences**:
  - The sidebar collapsed/expanded state and the stream-history table page size are now remembered across sessions
    (the active theme was already persisted), so the UI restores your last layout on reload.

- **Explicit Button Type On Shared Controls**:
  - The shared `IconButton` and `TextButton` primitives now render with `type="button"`, preventing accidental
    form submission when used inside forms.

- **Disk-Space Alerts**:
  - Added a threshold-based disk-usage monitor (Normal / Warn / Critical) implemented in
    `backend/app/src/api/sys_usage.rs::DiskAlertMonitor`. The background sampler ticks every 2 seconds (fixed,
    not configurable — see `SYSTEM_USAGE_INTERVAL` in that file) and the state machine decides when to emit
    a `DiskAlert` to the existing messaging channels (Telegram, Discord, Pushover, REST).
  - The state machine emits a `DiskAlert` whenever the level is non-Normal **and** (`state_changed` **or**
    `repeat_interval_secs` elapsed since the last notification). Long-running full-disk situations therefore
    re-notify periodically instead of going silent after the initial transition.
  - Configurable thresholds: `messaging.disk_alert.warn_percent` (default `80.0`),
    `messaging.disk_alert.critical_percent` (default `95.0`), and the re-arm interval
    `messaging.disk_alert.repeat_interval_secs` (default `3600`, i.e. 1 hour). The sampling interval is
    **not** configurable.
  - Operators can opt out of disk-alert messages by simply not declaring a `disk_alert` block under
    `messaging`, keeping the feature strictly opt-in and backward compatible.
  - Custom message templates per channel are supported via the standard
    `messaging.<channel>.templates.disk_alert_*` Handlebars hooks (e.g.
    `messaging.telegram.templates.disk_alert_warn`, `messaging.discord.templates.disk_alert_critical`).
    A clear plain-text fallback is used when no template is configured.

- **Shift+Click Range Selection For API-User Playlist Categories**:
  - In the API-user playlist editor, holding `Shift` while clicking a category now selects or deselects the whole
    range between the last anchor and the clicked item.
  - Plain mouse drag without `Shift` still allows normal text selection, while `Shift+drag` no longer shows a brief
    browser text highlight before the range selection is applied.

- **Descriptive Image Alt Text**:
  - Logo images on the login screen and sidebar now use the configured app title for their alt text, and playlist
    channel logos use the channel title, improving screen-reader accessibility.

- **Popup Menu Keyboard Dismissal**:
  - Popup menus now close when pressing `Escape`, in addition to clicking outside, improving keyboard accessibility.

- **Accessible Modal Dialogs**:
  - All dialogs (confirm, content, and custom) now expose `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal`, trap keyboard focus
    within the dialog while open (Tab/Shift+Tab cycle through its controls), close on `Escape` when dismissable,
    and restore focus to the previously focused element when closed. Confirm dialogs also expose their title as an
    accessible label.

- **Recoverable Error Boundary**:
  - Added an `ErrorBoundary` component that wraps each main view (dashboard, stats, streams, downloads, users,
    sources, playlists, EPG, RBAC, config) and the API-user playlist, so a recoverable failure shows a fallback with
    a retry button instead of leaving the section blank — and a failure in one view no longer affects the others.
  - Descendants can report a recoverable error through the boundary's context handle; retrying re-mounts the
    protected subtree so the user can recover without reloading the whole app.

- **Runtime-Discovered UI Languages With RTL Support**:
  - The frontend now reads the available UI languages at runtime from an `assets/i18n/index.json` manifest, so adding a
    language only requires shipping a `<code>.json` locale file and adding an entry to the manifest — no code change.
  - A language picker appears in the toolbar (next to the theme picker) whenever more than one language is available,
    and the chosen language is remembered across sessions.
  - Each language declares its text direction (`ltr`/`rtl`); the document direction is updated accordingly, providing
    baseline support for right-to-left languages such as Arabic.

- **Confirmation For Destructive Download/Recording Actions**:
  - Cancelling a transfer/recording and removing a download entry now prompt a confirmation dialog before proceeding.
  - The confirmation dialog focuses the safe (Cancel) action by default, consistent with other destructive actions
    (delete user, delete target, delete RBAC user/group).

- **Toast Notification UX Upgrade**:
  - Auto-dismiss toasts now show a countdown progress bar that reflects the remaining time before they disappear.
  - Hovering a toast pauses both the dismiss timer and its progress bar, and resumes from where it left off on mouse leave.
  - Error toasts gain a "copy details" action that copies the full message to the clipboard for easier bug reports.
  - The progress bar and entrance animation respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting.

- **M3U Catchup / Archive Preservation And Proxying**:
  - Tuliprox now preserves standard M3U catchup/archive attributes during M3U import and export.
  - Supported preserved attributes include:
    - `catchup`
    - `catchup-days`
    - `catchup-source`
    - `catchup-time`
    - `catchup-correction`
    - `catchup-type`
    - additional unknown `catchup-*` attributes
  - M3U catchup metadata is now stored under live stream properties and survives playlist rewrite/output generation.
  - XMLTV `catchup-id` is now imported, merged and exported alongside programme data.
  - Reverse-proxied M3U outputs can now expose local Tuliprox catchup/archive URLs instead of leaking provider archive URLs.
  - Catchup URL templates now resolve indexed parameters and common player query forms such as `utc` / `lutc` and
    `utcstart` with `offset` or `duration`.
  - Native Flussonic archive playback supports HLS (`.m3u8`) and MPEG-TS (`.ts`) paths. This includes flat archive
    requests used by TiviMate and nested Flussonic archive paths.
  - Live M3U entries that provide `timeshift` without a separate catchup block now use that value as Flussonic-style
    catchup metadata instead of being rejected as non-live archive requests.
  - Archive timestamps are retained when Tuliprox follows same-origin child HLS playlists. Segment, key and
    initialization URLs are left unchanged apart from normal relative URL resolution.
  - Generated M3U playlists advertise the user's Tuliprox XMLTV endpoint through both `url-tvg` and `x-tvg-url` when
    server information is available.
  - Per-channel `#EXTVLCOPT:http-user-agent` values are imported and used for upstream HLS and MPEG-TS requests. The
    directive is only written to playlists that still contain direct provider URLs.

- **Per-User Output Clusters**: API proxy users can now be restricted to specific clusters on their assigned target via
  `output_clusters`.
  - Supported values: `live`, `vod`, `series`.
  - The filter is evaluated per user and limits which clusters are visible and deliverable for that account.
  - At least one cluster should be selected if you want an active restriction.
  - If no cluster is selected, the filter is treated as inactive and Tuliprox serves all clusters for that user.
- **Input Resolve Filter**: Added `resolve_filter` option to input configuration to selectively resolve only entries matching a filter expression.
- **Input Probe Filter**: Added `probe_filter` option to input configuration to selectively probe only entries matching a filter expression.
- **Soft Connections And Soft Priority**: API users can now be configured with `soft_connections` and `soft_priority`.
  - Soft connections allow a user to consume additional preemptible provider slots above `max_connections`.
  - `soft_priority` is only applied while a connection is using a soft slot; once a regular slot becomes available again, the running connection  
    is promoted back to `Normal` and uses the user's normal `priority`.
  - The soft-vs-normal classification is now preserved through provider-backed stream creation, HLS session handling, and shared live-stream reuse.
  - The Web UI user editor now exposes both soft connection count and soft priority.
  - The user DB schema is upgraded accordingly to persist the new fields.
- **Download And Recording Manager**: The Web UI download feature has been expanded into a provider-aware download/recording manager.
  - VOD, series and episode downloads now use typed transfer snapshots across REST and websocket updates.
  - Download state in the Web UI is websocket-driven after the initial snapshot instead of relying on repeated REST polling.
  - Live entries can be scheduled as recordings through an `ffmpeg`-based recording worker.
  - Download and recording tasks now respect provider capacity and join the normal priority/preemption model instead of bypassing provider limits.
  - Download snapshots and actions are integrated into RBAC through the dedicated `download.read` and `download.write` permissions.
  - Background fairness controls were added under `video.download`:
    - `reserve_slots_for_users`
    - `max_background_per_provider`
    - `download_priority`
    - `recording_priority`
  - Transient retries now use exponential backoff with jitter and an explicit retry ceiling via:
    - `retry_backoff_initial_secs`
    - `retry_backoff_multiplier`
    - `retry_backoff_max_secs`
    - `retry_backoff_jitter_percent`
    - `retry_max_attempts`
  - Transfer snapshots now expose `WaitingForCapacity`, `RetryWaiting`, `retry_attempts` and `next_retry_at`.
  - Waiting transfers stay cancelable/pausable while they are blocked on provider capacity or retry backoff.
  - The download scheduler and active worker now participate in config hot reloads and restart under updated `video.download` settings.
  - Corrupted persisted download state is renamed to a timestamped `*_corrupt.*.json` backup and no longer blocks server startup.
  - Playlist Explorer download and recording actions are hidden without `download.write`, and duplicate queue requests now return the existing  
    task instead of creating a second entry.
  - The Playlist Explorer now supports:
    - optional priority override for VOD/series/episode downloads
    - start time, duration and optional priority override for live recordings
  - Missed scheduled recordings are now terminalized during recovery/promotion instead of being replayed late.
  - Preempted or retried live recordings continue with the remaining recording window instead of restarting with the full original duration.
- **QoS Aggregation Persistence**: Added a new persisted QoS snapshot repository (`qos_snapshot.db` + `qos_snapshot_meta.db`) in the storage directory.
  These files are maintained automatically by the QoS aggregation worker and become part of the local persistent runtime state.
- **Stream History QoS Foundation**: Stream history now captures structured QoS-relevant stream lifecycle data for later  
  reliability analysis and failover preparation.
  - Added `connect_failed` as a first-class event type for startup failures before a stable session exists.
  - Added structured `failure_stage` classification (`admission`, `provider_open`, `first_byte`, `streaming`, `session_reconnect`).
  - Added `connect_failure_reason` for startup/admission failures such as exhausted user/provider capacity.
  - Added structured provider failure metadata via `provider_error_class` and `provider_http_status`.
  - Added stable stream identity fields for cross-run QoS aggregation:
    - `input_name`
    - `stream_identity_key`
    - `stream_url_hash`
  - Added shared-stream QoS markers:
    - `shared_joined_existing`
    - `shared_stream_id`
  - Stream disconnect history now stores meaningful `disconnect_reason` values:
    - `provider_error`
    - `provider_closed`
    - `preempted`
    - `session_expired`
    - `client_closed`
- **Connect Failure Recording**: Admission and provider-open failure paths now write `connect_failed` records into stream  
  history instead of only surfacing fallback responses.
  This includes exhausted user/provider capacity and provider-open/channel-unavailable style startup failures.
- **QoS Snapshot Aggregator**: Added a periodic QoS aggregation worker that reads stream history partitions and persists  
  compact QoS snapshots per stream identity.
  - Uses a dedicated B+Tree snapshot repository.
  - Maintains rolling `24h`, `7d`, and `30d` windows from daily buckets.
  - Runs outside the streaming hotpath and processes history incrementally in the background.
- **QoS Snapshot Tooling**:
  - Added `--dbq` to inspect the QoS snapshot database from the CLI DB viewer.
  - Added backend QoS snapshot read endpoints for summary/detail access.
  - QoS snapshot API supports both JSON and CBOR responses depending on the request `Accept` header.
  - The Web UI now shows QoS summary/detail data alongside stream history and requests QoS data via CBOR.
- **QoS Configuration**: Added a dedicated `reverse_proxy.qos_aggregation` configuration block to control the periodic aggregator.
- HLS session expiry now emits a disconnect history record with reason `session_expired`.
- A minimal stdout logger is now initialized at the very start of the process so that
  errors during path resolution and early startup are always visible in the console.
- **Stream History Writer Block Bounds**: Stream-history block headers now use the real min/max event timestamps of the  
  batch instead of assuming the first/last batch element is time-sorted.
- **CLI Viewer Testability**: The stream-history viewer no longer calls `process::exit()` internally; exit handling now  
  happens in `main`, making the path easier to test and reuse.
- **Admission Failure Deduplication**: Repeated admission failure response logic in `hls_api`, `m3u_api`, and `xtream_api`  
  has been centralized into shared helpers.
- **API User Network Access Restrictions**: API proxy users can now be restricted by source CIDR ranges and/or GeoIP country
  codes via `network_access`.
  - Matching any configured CIDR or any configured country is sufficient for access.
  - Network access checks are centralized in the API user request context so denied requests stop before endpoint handling
    or upstream forwarding.
  - Country-based checks require the GeoIP database. If GeoIP is unavailable, the secure default is to deny requests that
    did not match a configured CIDR.
  - Operators can explicitly opt into allowing this GeoIP-unavailable country-rule case with
    `reverse_proxy.geoip.unavailable_policy: allow`.
  - CIDR-only misses, unknown countries, and country mismatches still deny.
- **QoS Aggregation Efficiency**:
  - QoS snapshot listing does not rely on a full unbounded materialization path for filtered UI/API reads.
  - Current-day QoS rebuilds are skipped when the history day is unchanged.
  - Snapshot traversal APIs were reduced to a single repository traversal style to avoid duplicated code paths.

- **Connection Admission Rules**: Added configurable admission strategies to `reverse_proxy.stream.admission_strategies`
  that control how Tuliprox handles new stream requests when the user or provider connection limit is reached.
  - `evict_user_same_ip_oldest` — evicts the oldest active connection from the same user and IP to make room.
  - `evict_user_same_ip_latest` — evicts the newest active connection from the same user and IP to make room.
  - `evict_user_oldest` — evicts the oldest active connection for the same user, regardless of IP.
  - `evict_user_latest` — evicts the newest active connection for the same user, regardless of IP.
  - `grace_instant_stream` — grants a grace period and immediately starts streaming.
  - `grace_hold_stream` — grants a grace period but holds stream output until the grace check completes.
  - Strategies are evaluated in order; the first matching strategy wins and blocks later ones.
  - Configuration rejects obviously shadowed orderings where `evict_user_oldest` is placed before `evict_user_same_ip_oldest`,
    or `evict_user_latest` before `evict_user_same_ip_latest`.
  - `grace_instant_stream` and `grace_hold_stream` are mutually exclusive.
  - Grace strategies require `grace_period_millis > 0`.
  - Added comprehensive connection handling documentation covering failures, user-visible behavior, priorities, sessions, and reconnects.
  - Added two new runtime-flow handbook pages:
    - operator-facing current runtime flow
    - developer-facing runtime internals and activity flow
- **Session Handling Boundary**: HLS and catchup remain session-based for continuity and provider affinity, but regular TS/VOD/local playback is now
  enforced as socket-bound admission.
  - A second non-HLS socket now counts as a second user connection even for the same user, IP, and stream.
  - This prevents parallel TS/VOD sockets from being collapsed into one logical playback.
  - Soft connections still work normally: once `max_connections` is full, an additional socket may still be admitted as `Soft` when
    `soft_connections > 0`, and provider-side priority/preemption rules still apply afterward.
  - Admission-driven evictions now record the just-evicted session briefly so aggressive player reconnect loops cannot immediately evict the new
    winner back out again.
  - This is not a full user cooldown: reconnects still succeed when a hard slot or soft slot is actually free, and switching to another channel is
    unaffected.
  - For socket-bound TS/VOD/local playback, the anti-ping-pong protection uses a short same-user, same-IP, same-channel winner guard because those
    clients do not provide a stable reconnect session identifier.
  - HLS activity refresh and cleanup dispatch were moved off the request/drop fast path so activity updates do not block segment responses and
    cleanup events are not silently lost when queues are temporarily full.
- **Provider URL Selection Strategy**: Added `provider_url_selection_policy` to provider definitions in `source.yml`.
  - `resume_last_working` (default) — after failover, the provider continues using the last known working URL until it fails again.
  - `restart_from_first` — after failover, the provider always tries from the first URL on the next request.
- **Structured Error Types**: Replaced the old `TuliproxErrorKind`-based error model with a typed `TuliproxError` enum
  using `thiserror`. Each config domain now has its own variant (e.g., `ConfigStream`, `ConfigInput`, `ConfigSource`,
  `ConfigApiProxy`, `ProxyUser`), making error messages precise and traceable.
- **Web UI Landing Page**: Added `landing_page` setting to `web_ui` config to choose the initial view after login.
  Supported values: `dashboard`, `stats`, `streams`, `stream_history`, `downloads`, `users`, `config`,
  `source_editor`, `playlist_update`, `playlist_settings`, `playlist_explorer`, `playlist_epg`, `rbac`.
- **Stream Display Visibility Controls**: Added optional `web_ui.stream_info` config to hide selected fields in the
  active stream display.
  - Supported flags:
    - `hide_group`
    - `hide_ip`
    - `hide_country`
    - `hide_shared`
    - `hide_duration`
    - `hide_bandwidth`
    - `hide_transferred`
    - `hide_player`
    - `hide_user_comment`
    - `hide_epg`
  - If all flags are `false`, the config is treated as absent and the default view remains unchanged.
  - Hidden `epg` also suppresses the per-stream EPG fetch/display work in the dashboard.
- **Runtime Config Report**: Added opt-in startup dump of the complete effective runtime configuration.
  - `log.runtime_config_report_enabled` (default `false`) — enables the report.
  - `log.runtime_config_report_format` — `yaml` (default) or `json`.
  - Sensitive values (passwords, secrets, tokens, API keys) are automatically redacted.
  - Includes prepared `config.yml`, `source.yml`, loaded mappings/templates/api-proxy sections, and resolved paths.
- **CVD-Friendly Theme**: Web UI now includes a CVD (color vision deficiency) friendly theme option.
- **Stream View**:
  - Displays the user comment in the stream view.
  - Displays EPG information in the stream view.
- **Shared HLS Streams**
  - Added advanced video routing with HLS and TS support, including HLS provisioning polling and correct byte-range
    handling for TS output.
  - Introduced live HLS reverse-proxy caching with lifecycle scheduling, garbage collection, and improved demand/prefetch backpressure.
  - Added smarter HLS playback access/admission handling for consistent manifest responses.

## ⚙️ Optimizations

- **The effective admission strategy list is carried as `Arc<[AdmissionStrategy]>`**: `GraceResolutionContext` is
  stored on `StreamInfo` and travels with every clone of it, so a `Vec<AdmissionStrategy>` field meant reallocating the
  list on each clone — and `get_effective_admission_strategies` handed back a fresh `Vec` that the context builder then
  cloned again. The list is immutable once resolved, so the context clone is now a refcount bump and the one allocation
  left is the `Arc::from` at resolution time. The strategy loop still takes a plain `&[AdmissionStrategy]`, reached by
  deref, so slicing the remaining strategies is unchanged.

- **Watch pattern matching walks the groups once**: matching re-tested every configured pattern per group inside a
  filter. It now walks the groups once and records which patterns hit — which is also what makes
  `playlist.watch.unmatched` possible.

- **Notification templates are resolved and compiled once**: `resolve_template` wrapped every template value in an
  input source and ran a full download attempt — once per message, per channel. A `file://` template was re-read from
  disk and an `http://` one re-fetched over the network for every notification, and an *inline* Handlebars string paid
  for a download attempt too. The source is now classified once (inline / file / URL), local files revalidate on mtime
  so an edit applies immediately, remote documents cache on a 5-minute TTL, and compiled templates are kept in a
  registry so rendering is no longer a re-parse. When a remote template cannot be refreshed the cached copy is served
  rather than silently degrading to the built-in text. Config validation can now compile-check a template body without
  sending, surfacing a malformed template at load instead of leaving a per-send error and a plausible-looking fallback.

- **Notification sends are concurrent and bounded**: the outbox awaited channels in sequence and the shared HTTP client
  sets no request timeout, so one webhook host that accepted a connection and never answered could stall every pending
  notification — including the recording ones the outbox exists to protect. Sends now run concurrently per channel with
  a 30-second request timeout. The channel set (and the `reqwest::Client` behind it) is built once and cached rather
  than reconstructed on every send.

- **Filtered event subscriptions**: every subscriber used to receive all event kinds and filter afterwards — after the
  broadcast channel had already cloned the message for it. A subscriber now declares a one-word mask and is never woken
  for what it did not ask for. The notification bridge is the first user: the four kinds it drops are the bulk of the
  traffic during a playlist refresh. The two largest payloads (the system-info and downloads samples) are carried behind
  `Arc`, costing a refcount bump per receiver instead of a deep copy, and the last subscriber standing pays nothing.

- **Event coalescing for payload-free nudges**: the recording-changed nudge is emitted from six routes, twice
  back-to-back where deleting a recording also changes the rules, and once per item in a bulk operation — each one
  making every Web UI session re-fetch the same snapshot. Nudges that carry no payload are now coalesced in a 250 ms
  window measured from the last admitted send, so a sustained stream is throttled to one per window rather than one per
  burst and a later user action always produces a visible refresh. An event carrying a payload is never coalesced,
  however repetitive, because a dropped tick loses the message it carried.

- **Static dispatch through the messaging, event and processing paths**: the notification layer's
  `Vec<Arc<dyn NotificationChannel>>` and its boxed future per send, the event sink, the metadata update sink, and the
  playlist-update bootstrap were all trait objects behind heap-allocated futures. All of them are now static: channels
  dispatch through an enum the compiler turns into a direct call, and the sinks are type parameters whose absent case
  is a zero-sized no-op that compiles away entirely. The send path allocates nothing, and emitting an event on the
  playlist pipeline is a direct call rather than a vtable hop. Same delivery semantics, same 46 messaging tests.

- **Playlist repository iterators no longer box**: the hottest traversal in the repository returned
  `Box<dyn Iterator + Send>` from three methods on a trait that is never used as a trait object, paying one allocation
  per call plus one uninlinable indirect call per playlist item — and the cluster skip-set filter boxed a second time on
  top. The adapter chains are replaced by named state machines and an enum per source kind, so a filtered traversal now
  allocates nothing at all. Two async methods drop `BoxFuture` for plain `async fn` at the same time.

- **One shared M3U/Xtream playlist backend**: the two raw-playlist iterators were transcriptions of one design — the
  same two read locks, the same blocking producer feeding a bounded channel, the same sorted-index reader — differing
  only in item type, storage subdirectory and error constructor. Those differences are now associated types and consts
  on a zero-sized marker, so 151 lines of duplicated logic became one implementation with entirely static dispatch. The
  one behavioural difference that was preserved rather than normalised (M3U holds its read lock for the consumer's
  lifetime, Xtream never did) is now named in the type rather than implicit.

- **Redundant `Arc` clones dropped from the Xtream per-item parse loop**: four fields wrapped a clone around an accessor
  that already returns an owned value, so each parsed Xtream stream paid four redundant atomic increment/decrement pairs
  on the playlist parse path. The workspace now has zero `Arc::clone(&x.y())` sites.

- **Typed field access on playlist item headers**: the mapper, sort and counter paths reached fields by string name,
  walking a chain of ~20 case-insensitive comparisons and returning an owned `Arc<str>` — so reading `chno` or `type`
  did a heap allocation *and* an interner write lock, on every read, per item, per rule. Field access is now keyed on a
  typed enum with a borrowing read that never forces an allocation, and mapper counter fields are parsed once at config
  load instead of re-parsed per channel inside the counter loop.

- **BPlusTree store path rewritten to stream to disk**: `BPlusTree::store` no longer buffers a full
  `Vec<[u8; PAGE_SIZE]>` (up to ~270 MiB for large playlists) before writing. A new `PageSink` hands out
  page ids and writes each finished page positionally to the destination file. Pages are written out of
  order — leaves are reserved before the overflow chains they point at — so positional writes are required.
  `verify_full` re-reads the file before it is published, catching any write-ordering bug. Peak RAM during
  store drops by the full `Vec` size; on a 70 000-entry playlist build this measured as ~270 MiB.

- **Per-batch commit on playlist import**: each `BATCH_SIZE` (1000) entries are now committed to the
  BPlusTree before the next batch is read. Previously the whole import ran inside one transaction and
  accumulated a `dirty_pages` map of every modified page between commits — bounded by total feed size.
  With per-batch commit, `dirty_pages` is bounded by `BATCH_SIZE` pages plus the size of one batch
  in flight. Wall-clock cost is one extra `fsync` per batch (~70 batches for 70 000 entries, ~7 ms
  total on SSD); peak RAM cost drops proportionally.

- **Positional file write helper**: new `write_all_at_offset` in
  `backend/btree/src/common.rs` mirrors the existing
  `read_exact_at_offset`. Uses `FileExt::write_all_at` on Unix and an explicit short-write
  retry loop on Windows. Previously a bug in this area would have left the database file
  silently truncated or scrambled; the short-write loop is the same pattern used by
  `read_exact_at_offset`.

- **Quick-XML read buffer pre-allocation**: `parse_tvguide` now starts its `Vec<u8>` with
  `with_capacity(64 * 1024)` instead of `Vec::new()`. The buffer is monotonically grown by quick-xml
  (it returns `&buf[start..]` between events; the caller does not clear it), and the largest single
  XML event in a typical XMLTV feed is a programme description that can grow to ~163 MiB. Starting at
  zero capacity triggered ~25 doubling reallocations along the way; starting at 64 KiB reduces
  the realloc chain and avoids the first costly zero-to-4 KiB jump. A regression test feeds a
  200 KiB programme description and asserts the parser still produces the expected events.

- **Stack-allocated JSON number parser**: `serde_utils::deserialize_number_from_string` previously
  called `serde_json::Number::to_string()` — a heap allocation per call. A new `StackNumber` (32-byte
  stack buffer) is filled via `fmt::Write` and then parsed in place. The 32-byte size is the
  maximum render of any `serde_json::Number` (`-1.7976931348623157e-308` is 24 bytes, so 32 leaves
  headroom); it deliberately takes `&Number` rather than `impl Display` to avoid being misused
  with a raw `f64` (whose `Display` impl writes 310 bytes for `f64::MIN` and would silently truncate
  to `None`). Affects every `EpgProgramme` field deserialized from `XtreamPlaylistItem` — measurable
  on a 70 000-channel feed.

- **UUID hashing skips the to_string allocation**: `generate_provider_playlist_uuid` and
  `generate_local_playlist_uuid` now use `PlaylistItemType::as_str()` (a `&'static str`) instead of
  `to_string()` (a fresh heap `String`). Same byte input, no allocation. A test
  (`item_type_label_is_hash_stable_against_display`) guards against a future `Display` impl that
  stops delegating to `as_str()` — the hash result is byte-equal to a hash built from the old
  `to_string()` form, so all existing persisted UUIDs remain stable.

- **Disk-based EPG processing (`disk_based_processing = true`)**: each EPG source's
  `EpgMergeAccumulator` now drains directly into a temp `BPlusTree` on disk via
  `finish_into_disk(path, source_priority, source_order)`, batched at 100 channels. The temp file
  is removed by a `DiskEpgSource` `Drop` guard, so a panic or early return cannot leak
  temp files. A `merge_epg_trees` function does the multi-way merge at the end with
  `O(n_sources + total_channels)` complexity (per-channel priority resolution inside
  `EpgMergeAccumulator::upsert_channel`). The previous loss of per-source priority in the
  wire-up (`set_attributes_if_preferred(0, 0, ...)`) is fixed: `DiskEpgSource` carries
  `source_priority` and `source_order`, and `merge_epg_trees` reads them. Behaviour is gated on
  `config.disk_based_processing`; when false, the existing in-memory `flatten_tvguide` path is
  unchanged. On a 70 720-channel feed this reduced the EPG-parse phase peak from ~340 MiB to a
  per-source-batch bounded value. Note: the final merged `Epg` still materialises a
  `Vec<Arc<EpgChannel>>` (the downstream consumers expect that shape); the constant-memory
  guarantee is on the write side only. A regression test for the wire-up path uses shared
  channel ids across two sources to exercise the priority-override `Occupied` branch and
  fails loudly if it ever breaks.

- **Readiness hot path trimmed for frequent polling**: `/ready` is typically polled every few seconds by load
  balancers. The member→group lookup table is now derived once when the source config loads
  (`SourcesConfig.group_lookup`) instead of being rebuilt on every request; the saturation check consumes an
  iterator of provider slots and accumulates the few groups in a linear `Vec` scan instead of allocating a
  `HashMap` per call; and the response is a typed `ReadyResponse` struct instead of a `serde_json::json!` DOM
  tree. The only remaining per-request work is the live connection walk, which cannot be cached.

- **Health banner render allocations**: provider rows now hold shared `Arc<str>` names instead of freshly
  allocated `String`s, and the saturation check iterates the rows instead of cloning them into an intermediate
  `Vec` on every render. Backend and frontend share one `CapacityGroup`/`build_group_lookup` implementation in
  the `shared` crate, so `/ready` and the banner can no longer drift apart in how they group inputs and aliases.

## 🐛 Fixes

- **Trakt curation now requires an explicitly configured Client ID.** Tuliprox no longer bundles or falls back to a
  shared Client ID. Blank or header-invalid `trakt.api.api_key` values now produce one target-scoped warning and skip
  only optional Trakt curation without making an HTTP request; other target processing continues. Trakt `401`, `403`,
  `404`, and `429` responses now have actionable, resource-aware messages, while independently successful lists and
  charts remain available.

- **Empty playlist updates no longer replace previously published input or target data.** A completely empty refresh is
  treated as a failed update and keeps the last usable playlist and its virtual-ID mapping intact. This prevents
  transient provider/download failures from making channels disappear or assigning different IDs when service
  recovers. An intentionally empty target must therefore be disabled or filtered operationally instead of being
  published as an empty refresh.

- **M3U alias failover now uses the allocated provider's opaque query credentials.** When capacity allocation moved a
  stream from the primary input to an alias, a playlist URL carrying credentials such as `token` or `api_key` could
  retain the primary provider's value because failover only understood base URLs and username/password credentials.
  Tuliprox now matches authentication-like query fields against the configured M3U account URL and replaces both key
  and value with those of the selected provider while preserving unrelated query parameters. Different key names such
  as `token` and `api_key` are mapped only for an unambiguous one-to-one pair; ambiguous mappings fail closed.
- **Admission: a request that ended up denied anyway could leave several other streams killed behind it.** Eviction is
  destructive and is never rolled back, but the strategy loop would kick a target, find the retry still denied, and
  move straight on to the next eviction strategy. The loop now samples `user_connections` either side of the kick. A
  kick that reduces the count is real progress and later strategies still run, which keeps the over-limit case — a
  hot-swapped config that lowered `max_connections` — converging; a kick that frees nothing skips further `Evict`
  decisions for the rest of the walk. `Grace` strategies are still evaluated either way.
- **Admission: a request that lost the queue race walked the eviction strategies on a stale count.** The resolver read
  the admission state, then queued on the per-user gate, then used the snapshot it had taken *before* it queued — so it
  could evict a live connection to free a slot the winner had already released. The state is re-read after the gate
  (and after the empty-strategy check, so the uncontended path costs nothing extra) and the grace context captures the
  fresh kind. This does not close the wider check-then-register window: the slot is registered by the caller outside
  this gate, so two requests at `max_connections - 1` can still both be admitted.
- **Admission: a suppressed eviction misaligned the strategy index and replayed a grace strategy.** The loop counted
  with a manual index incremented at the end of the body, and the eviction-reentry suppression arm exits via `continue`
  and so skipped it, handing every later strategy an index one too low. That index is what
  `GraceResolutionContext.strategy_index` stores, and the post-grace fallback resumes at `strategy_index + 1`: with
  `[EvictUserOldest, GraceHoldStream]` and the eviction suppressed, the grace recorded index 0, so the fallback slice
  restarted at the grace strategy itself and replayed it instead of moving past it. Now counted with
  `iter().enumerate()`, so the index cannot drift from the item.
- **Events: watch payloads carried synthesized prose where a plugin expected channel titles.** The watch handler
  truncated its own lists by pushing a sentence into them — "... 42 more added entries omitted" beside real channel
  titles, or "5000 entries added. Detailed list suppressed" replacing the list outright. That was legible to the text
  template and to nothing else: the payload is serialized straight to JSON for plugins, and a plugin has no way to tell
  a sentinel from a channel actually named that. The subject line had the same problem from the other side — it read
  `added.len()`, so a suppressed change of five thousand announced itself as "1 channel(s) added". `WatchChanges` now
  carries `added_total`, `removed_total` and `truncated`; the lists stay pure channel titles, the counts stay true
  whatever the lists carry, and the plain-text renderer spells the omission out itself. `WatchChanges::new` sets the
  totals from the lists, so a caller that is not truncating cannot get them out of step.
- **Events: a failed local library scan reported itself as finished.** The failure path emitted the same progress
  variant with `status: Error`, and the taxonomy mapped that variant to the completion id unconditionally, so a failure
  reached operators as "A local library scan finished" at info severity. The id is now discriminated on the status the
  payload already carries — the way playlist updates have always discriminated on their state — and severity comes from
  the registry with no second table. The emitter was already reporting the status correctly; nothing downstream was
  reading it. See Breaking Changes for the subscription consequence.

- **Messaging: an edited bot token, webhook URL or template did not take effect until a restart.** The channel set and
  the compiled templates are cached so a notification does not rebuild every channel — and a fresh HTTP client with
  them — on every send, but nothing invalidated those caches on config reload. They are now invalidated when the config
  reloads.
- **Messaging: a successful playlist refresh with statistics notified twice.** The run summary went straight to the
  notification layer as a second message while the bus carried the bare outcome, and both resolved to
  `playlist.update.completed` — so one refresh produced two notifications, neither carrying the other's content, and a
  bus subscriber saw an outcome with no detail. The outcome, per-source statistics and aggregated error text are now one
  event emitted once at the end of the run. The WebSocket frame is unchanged, so the Web UI sees what it always did.
- **Messaging: disk alerts were gated on somebody being subscribed by mail.** The emission itself checked the
  subscription, so a plugin or any other consumer watching for disk pressure saw nothing unless an operator happened to
  want the same event on the same channel. The notification layer already drops unsubscribed events, so the check is
  gone.
- **Auth: changing a password invalidated nothing.** `pwd_version` was minted into every web token and checked in
  exactly one place — the refresh endpoint — so a token issued against the old password kept working on every guarded
  route until it expired. Together with `token_ttl_mins: 0` meaning ~100 years, a leaked token was effectively a
  permanent credential. The check now runs on every request whose principal is a web user, and rejects `pwd_version: 0`
  rather than treating it as "skip", which is how the refresh endpoint's own copy could be bypassed. Users will be
  signed out after a password change, which is the intent.
- **Auth: revoking a permission had no effect until the token expired.** The permission check read the snapshot minted
  into the token. The effective set is now the intersection of the claim with what the live config grants, so a
  revocation takes effect on the next request. A new *grant* still requires a refresh, because a token must never end up
  with more authority than it was issued with. Three permission paths that had drifted apart — one with no schema gate,
  no subject gate and no password-version check at all — now share one implementation.
- **Auth: the configured JWT issuer was never validated.** Token validation checked expiry and nothing else, so `iss`
  was decoration. It is now checked, including on the WebSocket paths, which previously carried a bare secret across
  task boundaries and so had no issuer to check against.
- **Auth: an access token minted for one purpose was valid everywhere.** Internal access tokens signed only a timestamp
  and a TTL, so any valid token verified at every place a token was accepted. The capability scope is now mixed into the
  keyed hash and is a compile-time constant on both sides, never caller-supplied. The token string format is unchanged.
- **Auth: renaming a user orphaned their recordings.** The JWT subject was synthesised from the display name
  (`web:{username}` / `api:{username}`), so a rename reassigned every recording the old subject owned to a principal
  that does not exist. Subjects now come from the identity registry, which was already built with persistence,
  bootstrap and a rename that preserves the id, and was simply never wired into the server. A corrupt registry refuses
  to start rather than inventing replacement ids.
- **Auth: passwords typed at the terminal were left in memory.** The interactive password generator left two plaintext
  `String`s sitting after it returned; they are now wiped, the same discipline already applied to a password arriving
  over HTTP. A dead duplicate of the credential type that was never declared in its crate root has been removed.
- **Notifications: a typo'd webhook burned every retry attempt.** Delivery outcomes could not distinguish "retry me"
  from "this URL is malformed and will fail identically forever", so a permanent failure ran the full exponential
  backoff before dead-lettering, and a `429` was retried straight back into the rate limit it had just hit.
- **Notifications: a newly added event kind was silently undiscoverable.** Template discovery iterated a hardcoded
  variant list rather than the event registry, so a new kind's templates were never found — a failure with no error
  message. It now iterates the registry, and still finds legacy template filenames.
- **Events: several event kinds reached no WebSocket subscriber at all.** The wire mapping was a hundred-line match
  nested three deep inside the socket loop, where a kind reaching no arm looked exactly like a kind deliberately
  ignored — and the test meant to catch that had been failing since the disk-alert event joined the bus. The mapping is
  now a pure function with tests that iterate every event kind, so a variant added later fails the tests instead of
  silently reaching nobody.
- **Events: a stream ending at shutdown lost its last window of transferred bytes.** The meter sampler was cancelled in
  `Drop`, which cannot await. The registry is now flushed explicitly at shutdown, after the connection manager, so the
  final batch reports what the streams actually transferred.
- **Events: the bus dropped events under load with nothing to show for it.** Capacity was hardcoded at 10 for
  everything, which a playlist refresh routinely outruns — the evidence was already in the tree, in a dedicated lag arm
  in the notification bridge and an entire resync recovery path in the WebSocket. Capacity is now configurable and
  defaults to 256, and drops are counted and reported at `GET /api/v1/events/stats`.
- **Config: mapper and counter field names were rejected for their casing.** The allow-list was compared
  case-sensitively while the field accessor compared case-insensitively, so a mapper naming `NAME` was rejected at
  config load even though writing it would have worked. Both now resolve through the same typed parse. Every previously
  valid config stays valid; some previously rejected ones are now accepted and behave correctly.
- **Config: a config report listed only the first bad rule.** Sort rules and target renames aggregate every child's
  error again, so a config with three bad rules reports all three in one pass rather than one round-trip at a time.
- **Stalker: a `403` was retryable or not depending on which layer noticed it.** The same refusal arrived as either a
  token rejection or a bad status, and callers were matching on variants to answer questions the variants were never
  organised around. Errors now carry a classification, and auth failures are deliberately not retryable so nothing loops
  on a rejected token. Provider redaction is also unified: the three unrelated answers to "what must never reach a log
  line" (error URLs, the debug-dump writer's inline key list, and the Xtream sanitizer) are now one module with one
  key list, and the JSON redaction walk catches nested keys, which the debug-dump writer's own copy never did.
- **Web UI: disk-space alerts could not be enabled from Config → Messaging.** The messaging form only included the
  `messaging.disk_alert` block when a threshold field was touched, and the save-time cleanup dropped the block whenever
  all thresholds still equalled their defaults — even though the block's presence is what enables the alerts. The
  `DiskAlert` entry in `notify_on` is now the on/off switch: checking it writes the block (default thresholds when
  untouched), unchecking removes it, and default-valued blocks are no longer stripped on save.
- **DVR: cancelling a recording could kill a different one.** `cancel_recording` read the active slot, compared the
  uuid, then called the no-uuid `cancel_active()`. If ffmpeg finished in between and the queue promoted another
  recording, that innocent recording was cancelled instead. Now cancels by uuid.
- **DVR: a disk-pressure sweep deleted the entire recording library.** The stop condition compared a free-space
  measurement taken once per pass against the low watermark, ignoring the bytes the pass had already reclaimed, so it
  was constant for the whole pass — false on the first candidate and false forever. A single trigger therefore deleted
  every completed recording instead of just enough of them. The projected free space now folds in what has been
  reclaimed.
- **DVR: the recording module did not build on Windows.** `utils::recording_paths` carried a blanket `#![cfg(unix)]`,
  which erased the module and left every caller with unresolved imports. The gate is now scoped to the single
  `O_NOFOLLOW` line it was needed for; the no-clobber and no-follow guarantees are carried by `create_new` and
  `symlink_metadata`, which behave identically on all supported targets.
- **DVR: `recording.enabled: false` was only half-honoured.** The REST routes refused requests while the rule
  scheduler kept materializing tasks and the WebSocket kept streaming recording data. All four gates — routes,
  scheduler, supervisors, socket — now share one predicate.
- **DVR: WebSocket delta filtering dropped tasks under load.** The visible-id set was built with `try_lock`/`try_read`
  on all four queue guards and silently skipped whichever was contended, so recordings vanished from the client until
  the next full snapshot. It now waits for the same committed boundary the snapshot path uses.
- **DVR: filenames were barely sanitized.** Only `/` and `\` were replaced, letting control characters,
  Windows-reserved characters, trailing dots/spaces, and BiDi override codepoints reach the path the muxer opens.
  Programme titles now pass through a single sanitizer that guarantees one safe path component.
- **DVR: duplicate detection was bypassable.** The key was `(url, start_at, duration_secs)` OR `file_path`. The
  `file_path` half was dead (paths are disambiguated with a `_N` suffix, so they never match) and `start_at` is
  `now.max(scheduled_start)`, so every request for a currently-airing programme produced a different key and could be
  booked repeatedly. Identity is now derived from the rule occurrence, or the programme and source per quota pool.
- **DVR: a failed rule delete could lose upcoming recordings.** `DELETE /rules/{id}?future=cancel` cancelled the
  occurrences first; if the rule store then failed, the rule stayed and its recordings were gone. The cancelled
  occurrences are now restored from a pre-cancel snapshot.
- **DVR: `recording_mut_at` could edit the wrong task.** The `Finished` arm returned element 0 rather than the located
  index. Currently unreachable, but a latent trap for any future caller.
- **DVR: a fatal ffmpeg error could loop until the window closed.** Retryability was decided by substring-matching the
  whole stderr line, which includes the source URL, so a provider path containing e.g. `connection-refused` made every
  failure look transient. URL-shaped tokens are now stripped before classification.
- **DVR: deletion authorization and the state transition could disagree.** The task was looked up, authorized,
  stamped, then looked up a second time, and the second lookup could see a different task. Authorization now runs
  inside the same mutation boundary that stamps it.
- **DVR: the `owner=` task filter accepted arbitrary values for non-administrators.** It returned an empty list rather
  than refusing, which read as if cross-owner queries were supported. Now `403` unless the caller is an administrator.
- **DVR: an ineligible edit reported a misleading reason.** Clearing rule provenance surfaced as
  `recording_invalid_state`; it now has its own `recording_provenance_immutable` code.
- **DVR: task status was rendered as Rust debug output.** The recording library showed `format!("{:?}", status)`,
  untranslated and inconsistent with the downloads view. Both now share one localized status pill, and every recording
  error code has a translated message in all shipped locales.
- **DVR: the socket could not report an actionable refusal.** A token predating a permission-schema bump produced an
  empty task list, indistinguishable from "you have no recordings", while REST correctly answered
  `recording_token_refresh_required`. A new `RecordingWsError { code }` frame carries the reason.
- **DVR: `NewEpisode` rules never matched anything.** The scheduler passes an empty EPG horizon to the planner, which
  matches those rules by walking programmes, so only `WeeklyTimeslot` rules could materialize. The horizon is still
  not wired, but the condition is now logged once per process instead of looking like a scheduler that found nothing.

- **Mapper Regex Capture Results**:
  - Regex expressions now evaluate one complete match instead of flattening later matches into duplicate,
    unreachable capture keys.
  - Every capture group from that match remains accessible by index (`.1` through `.n`), and named groups remain
    accessible by both index and name. A single unnamed capture also supports `.1` without losing scalar use.

- **Media servers no longer show a duplicate movie for every extra provider listing (STRM `flat` mode)**: under
  `flat: true` the movie folder is deduplicated by TMDB id, but each file was still named after *its own*
  provider title. Providers routinely list the same film twice with the tag written differently
  (`X [MULTI-SUB] - 2021` vs `X - 2021 [Multi Sub]`), so the second listing landed in the first one's folder
  under a name that does not start with the folder name — exactly what Jellyfin/Emby require in order to group
  alternate versions. Jellyfin's `VideoListResolver` then abandons version grouping for the *whole* folder and
  shows one movie per file. Every listing that reuses a folder is now named after that folder, so the existing
  `add_quality_to_filename` suffix (or the `[Version id#N]` collision suffix) distinguishes them and the media
  server shows a single movie with selectable versions. Applies to the `jellyfin`, `emby` and `kodi` styles.
  **Note:** this renames existing files in `flat` STRM trees; with `cleanup: true` the old names are removed on
  the next update.

- **The provider category is no longer appended to STRM movie file names in `flat` mode**: it was added as a
  collision guard, but the only files that can now collide are versions of the same movie (same TMDB folder,
  same quality string), which the existing `[Version id#N]` pass already separates. Jellyfin and Emby render
  whatever follows the folder name as the *version label*, so the category leaked into the version picker; the
  label now reads as the quality alone. Items with no TMDB id still carry the category — it is what keeps their
  folder unique — and for the `jellyfin` and `emby` styles they now carry it in the file name too, so the name
  still starts with the folder name (it previously did not, which quietly broke version detection for those
  items). `kodi` is unchanged here: it has no filename-starts-with-folder-name convention.

- **Two STRM versions of the same movie could silently overwrite each other when the name was very long**: the
  `[Version id#N]` suffix that tells colliding versions apart was appended last, and the writer then truncates
  the file stem to 250 characters — so for a long title the only distinguishing part was cut off and both
  versions resolved to the same path. The shared base is now trimmed instead, so the version label always
  survives.

- **Quality tags no longer demote widescreen films a resolution tier**: `MediaQuality` classified the
  resolution from the frame *height* alone. A letterboxed 2.40:1 film mastered at 1080p is 1920x796, so it was
  tagged `720p HD`; a 2.40:1 UHD master (3840x1600) was tagged `1440p QHD`. Resolution is now taken from the
  higher of the width-derived and height-derived tier, so scope films land in the tier they were mastered at.
  Height alone still decides when the width is unknown. Affects `add_quality_to_filename` STRM names.

- **STRM files are no longer rewritten on every playlist update**: authenticated tokens (STRM
  `/provider/resolve/…` URLs and M3U catchup URLs) used a random IV, so re-encoding the same item produced a
  different token every run. That made every STRM file's content differ on each update, so the existing
  `has_strm_file_same_hash` skip in `strm_repository` never matched and the whole STRM tree was rewritten every
  time (measured: ~28k files rewritten by a no-op update). The IV is now derived synthetically (SIV) from the
  secret, domain and payload, so the same item always encodes to the same token and unchanged STRM files are left
  alone. The token wire format is unchanged and the IV is still read from the token on decode, so **tokens issued
  by older versions keep working** — no STRM regeneration required.

- **Playlist Cache Load Failures No Longer Silent**: Xtream and M3U storage loads that fail due to corruption,
  version mismatch, or task panics now log an error before falling back to an empty playlist, instead of silently
  serving empty data. A genuinely missing storage file (first run) is logged at debug only, so normal startup stays
  quiet.
- **EPG Output Selection In Mixed Targets**: Fixed ambiguous EPG file selection when a target exposes both Xtream and M3U outputs.
  - Web UI playlist EPG and stream EPG APIs now explicitly prefer M3U EPG data and fall back to Xtream when M3U EPG is unavailable.
  - Xtream short-EPG now explicitly resolves Xtream EPG data.
- **Playlist Series Info For Input/Custom Xtream**: Completed `series_info` handling for input-based and custom Xtream playlist requests.
  - Input and custom Xtream requests now resolve series details via provider `series_id` instead of returning empty (`204`) responses.
  - Target-based `series_info` behavior is unchanged.
- **Async Local File Serving**: The local-file stream handler now canonicalizes paths with `tokio::fs::canonicalize`
  instead of the blocking `std` call, so the async runtime is no longer blocked while resolving the file path.
- **Template Expansion Efficiency**: Optimized `template.yml` / `template.d` multi-template expansion so sequence-style templates no longer
  duplicate unrelated entries during dependency resolution.
  - Sequence templates still resolve correctly and preserve order.
  - Missing-template and cyclic-dependency validation remains unchanged.
  - This reduces config/Web UI load cost for larger nested template collections.
- **Shutdown Diagnostics**: Stream-history shutdown now reports dead worker situations instead of silently swallowing them.
- **Release Workflow Safety**:
  - `master` releases now refuse to build non-release versions when the patch component is not `0`.
  - The release-version validation now runs before expensive build steps for an early exit.
- **provider:// Scheme**: Fixed `provider://` URL scheme resolution for failover scenarios.
- **Log Level Change**: Fixed runtime log level changes not taking effect.
- **API User Category Selection**: Fixed API user category selection in the Web UI.
- **Refactored Playlist And EPG Explorer**: Playlist Explorer and EPG Explorer have been refactored for improved reliability and UX.
- HLS session info now reports accurate duration and total transferred data.
- Removed open-ssl dependency
- **Infinite Fallback Video Behind Reverse Proxy**: The 6 fallback custom videos (`channel_unavailable`,
  `user_connections_exhausted`, `provider_connections_exhausted`, `low_priority_preempted`,
  `user_account_expired`, `panel_api_provisioning`) used to be served with an HTTP 200 OK header even when they
  represented a stream failure. A reverse proxy with `proxy_intercept_errors on;` therefore could not sever the
  socket, and the connection would hang open for hours ("ghost connections" / socket exhaustion under scraper
  load).
  - The new top-level `custom_stream_response_enabled: false` switch turns the 6 fallback factories into no-op
    responses so the call sites return a real HTTP error code (default `502 Bad Gateway`,
    `custom_stream_response_error_status: <4xx|5xx>`) instead of the infinite MPEG-TS loop.
  - The default `true` is unchanged behaviour: the configured fallback video is still served.
  - All 6 factories are routed through a single helper (`create_video_stream`) so the new behavior is centralized
    and applies uniformly without per-call-site changes.
- **Readiness counted disabled providers as free capacity.** `/ready` and the health banner included disabled
  inputs and aliases in the capacity calculation — for example accounts that expired and were switched off during
  config preparation. A fully used setup could therefore still report spare slots through members that cannot
  accept connections. Readiness now only considers enabled inputs and aliases, matching the provider lineups that
  actually accept connections.
- **`/ready` could report phantom readiness with unusable capacity.** When no enabled input was left, the
  endpoint answered `initializing` or even `ready` instead of `503 exhausted`; an empty enabled-provider slot
  list is now always treated as exhausted. The group capacity accumulator was also widened from `u16` to `usize`,
  so groups whose members sum beyond 65 535 connections can no longer overflow into a wrong state.
- **Health banner marked groups saturated although a fallback was idle.** The banner derived its saturation
  slots only from providers with active connections, so an enabled alias without connections was invisible and
  its spare capacity ignored. Slots are now derived from the configured enabled members (missing live counts
  default to zero), matching the `/ready` endpoint.
- **Xtream: a VOD document could carry a blank `container_extension`, and players appended `.null` to the playback
  URL.** The field is filled from the provider's `get_vod_streams` response, where a missing or null value collapses
  to an empty string, and only a per-item `get_vod_info` fetch or an ffprobe run fills it in afterwards. A provider
  that omits it therefore left every VOD document carrying `""`, and a client building
  `<stream_id>.<container_extension>` has nothing to append — several render the blank as the literal string `null`
  and go on to request `813563.null`. `get_vod_info` already fell back to the extension carried by the item URL; the
  four document builders that did not — the stream-list document, both no-properties paths, and the resolved info
  document, which delegates to a `StreamProperties` method with no URL to consult — now share that fallback. A
  non-empty provider value still wins, and an item whose URL carries no extension either still reports the blank.
  `create_vod_info_from_item` had the fallback but kept the leading dot that `extract_extension_from_url` returns, so
  a URL-derived extension was published as `.mkv` and would have built `813563..mkv`; it is stripped now. Series
  episodes are unchanged: their properties carry no provider URL at that layer.

## ⚙️ New Settings

- **source.yml (target `options`)**:
  - Added optional `clear_invalid_epg_ids` (`bool`, default `false`) to clear unresolved live-channel EPG IDs after EPG
    matching and final mappings without removing playlist entries. The legacy name `required_epg` is accepted while
    reading existing configuration and is rewritten as `clear_invalid_epg_ids` when serialized.

- **config.yml (`video.download.recording`)**:
  - Added `enabled` (`bool`, default `true`): master switch for the DVR. When `false` the REST routes answer
    `501 recording_disabled`, the rule scheduler and supervisors idle, the WebSocket serves no recording data, and the
    sidebar entries are hidden. An absent `recording:` block still means "defaults", so upgrading never silently
    disables a DVR that was already in use.
  - Added `container_format` (`mpegts` | `matroska` | `mp4`, default `mpegts`): the muxer ffmpeg writes. Recordings
    were previously hard-coded to MPEG-TS regardless of the source codecs. MPEG-TS remains the default because it
    survives truncation — a recording killed mid-stream still plays.
  - Added `retention.sweep_interval_secs` (`u64`, default `3600`): cadence of the age/count retention sweep,
    independent of `disk.cleanup_interval_secs`, which paces the watermark check.
  - Added a `notifications` block governing the new lifecycle-notification outbox: `outbox_buffer` (default `1024`,
    fixed at startup), `max_attempts` (default `6`), `backoff_initial_secs` (default `5`), and `backoff_max_secs`
    (default `900`).
  - Startup now warns when the DVR is enabled with no retention policy, no disk watermarks, and no quota, since
    nothing then bounds recording disk usage.

- **source.yml (target `options.epg_output`)**:
  - Added optional `lowercase_ids` (`bool`, default `false`) to canonicalize technical EPG IDs with ASCII lowercase
    consistently across visible M3U `tvg-id`, Xtream `epg_channel_id`, XMLTV `<channel id>` / `<programme channel>`
    references, EPG API responses, and target EPG storage keys after a full target refresh. Disabled targets retain
    their existing source-case storage keys and ordering.
  - Added optional `lowercase_xmltv_display_names` (`bool`, default `false`) to lowercase only XMLTV `<display-name>`
    values during serialization; playlist names and programme metadata remain unchanged, and no persisted rebuild is
    normally required.
  - Both options are disabled by default, so existing visible outputs remain unchanged. Changing `lowercase_ids`
    requires a full target refresh, and clients may need to re-index EPG data once after visible IDs change.
- **config.yml (main)**:
  - Added `interner_gc_interval_secs`: interval in seconds between background string interner GC checks.
  - Added `interner_gc_min_pool_size`: minimum interned-string pool size required before background interner GC runs.
  - Added `custom_stream_response_enabled` (`bool`, default `true`): when `false`, the 6 fallback custom-video
    factories (`channel_unavailable`, `user_connections_exhausted`, `provider_connections_exhausted`,
    `low_priority_preempted`, `user_account_expired`, `panel_api_provisioning`) skip the configured
    MPEG-TS video and the call sites return `custom_stream_response_error_status` instead of an infinite
    200 OK loop. Use this behind a reverse proxy with `proxy_intercept_errors on;` to allow dead channels
    to be severed instead of pinning sockets open. The field lives in the main config (next to
    `custom_stream_response_path` / `custom_stream_response_timeout_secs`) rather than under
    `reverse_proxy.stream` because it is a custom-stream-response behaviour toggle, not a reverse-proxy
    behaviour setting.
  - Added `custom_stream_response_error_status` (`u16`, default `502`): HTTP status code returned when
    `custom_stream_response_enabled` is `false`. Must be a 4xx or 5xx code (`ConfigDto::prepare()` rejects
    anything else; `0` is silently clamped to the default `502`). Operators can match the code to their
    Nginx `proxy_intercept_errors on;` rules.
  - Added `event_channel_capacity` (`u32`, default `256`, clamped to at least `1`): capacity of the internal event
    broadcast channel. It was previously hardcoded at `10`, which a playlist refresh routinely outruns — a subscriber
    that awaits I/O per event falls behind within one target. Drops are visible at `GET /api/v1/events/stats`.
- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy.stream`)**:
  - Added `admission_strategies` (optional list): ordered list of admission strategy rules.
    Available strategies: `evict_user_same_ip_oldest`, `evict_user_same_ip_latest`, `evict_user_oldest`, `evict_user_latest`,  
    `grace_instant_stream`, `grace_hold_stream`.
- **config.yml (`messaging`)**:
  - `notify_on` is now a list of glob patterns over dotted event ids (`*`, `recording.*`, `provider.*.expired`, and a
    leading `!` to exclude). Legacy `MsgKind` names still parse and are normalized on the next save.
  - Added an `ntfy` channel: `url`, `topic`, optional `token`, optional `templates`, optional `routing`.
  - Added a `gotify` channel: `url`, `token`, optional `templates`, optional `routing`.
  - Added a `slack` channel: `url` (incoming webhook), optional `templates`, optional `routing`.
  - Added a `command` channel: `program`, optional `args`, optional `timeout_secs`, optional `templates`, optional
    `routing`. The program is executed directly, not through a shell, and receives the event JSON on stdin.
  - Added `rest.signing_secret` (optional): enables HMAC-SHA256 signing of `{timestamp}.{body}`, sent as
    `X-Tuliprox-Signature`.
  - Added an optional per-channel `routing` block on all eight channels. An absent block inherits the global
    subscription:
    - `notify_on` (list of glob patterns): overrides the global subscription for this channel.
    - `min_severity` (`info` | `warn` | `error` | `critical`): drops anything below it.
    - `quiet_hours` (`HH:MM-HH:MM`, local time): notifications inside the window are **deferred** by the outbox, never
      dropped. An entry is only held while every still-pending channel is asleep.
    - `max_per_hour` (`u32`): circuit breaker. On reaching it the channel sends one "suppressing further notifications"
      message and then goes quiet for the rest of the hour.
    - `dedup_window_secs` (`u64`): suppresses a repeated `dedup_key` for this many seconds. Generalizes the disk
      alert's `repeat_interval_secs`, which was previously available to nothing else.
  - Templates are now supported on every channel including Pushover, keyed by event id wire name, and every template
    receives a uniform `event.*` context alongside every legacy top-level key, so templates written against the
    documented examples render identically.

- **config.yml (`messaging.disk_alert`)**:
  - Added optional `disk_alert` block to enable disk-usage alerts via the existing messaging channels. The
    background monitor in `backend/app/src/api/sys_usage.rs` samples the current working directory's mount on
    every fixed 2-second tick and feeds each sample to the `DiskAlertMonitor` state machine
    (`backend/app/src/api/sys_usage.rs::DiskAlertMonitor`).
  - Fields:
    - `warn_percent` (`f64`, default `80.0`): percent-used at or above which the `Warn` level is reached.
      Must be in `[0, 100]`.
    - `critical_percent` (`f64`, default `95.0`): percent-used at or above which the `Critical` level is
      reached. Must be `> warn_percent` and in `[0, 100]`. The `prepare()` step rejects values that violate
      these bounds.
    - `repeat_interval_secs` (`u64`, default `3600`): re-arm interval in seconds. While the disk stays in
      the same alert state, the alert is **re-sent** after this many seconds. This is **not** the sampling
      interval — sampling is a fixed 2s and is not currently configurable. So if the disk is at 87% for 3
      hours with the default `repeat_interval_secs: 3600`, three `Warn` notifications are sent (one per
      hour), not one transition-only notification.
  - The state machine emits a `DiskAlert` whenever the level is non-Normal **and** (`state_changed` **or**
    `rearm_elapsed`); the level-transition-only behaviour of the original prototype was intentionally
    removed because long-running full-disk situations were going unnoticed.
  - Templates can override the default text per channel via
    `messaging.<channel>.templates.disk_alert_warn` / `disk_alert_critical` / `disk_alert_normal`.
- **api-proxy.yml (`user.credentials[]`)**:
  - Added `output_clusters` (optional list, default effective behavior `all`): restricts a user to `live`, `vod`,
    and/or `series` on the assigned target. If no cluster is selected, the filter is inactive and all clusters are
    served.
- **config.yml (`web_ui`)**:
  - Added `landing_page` (optional, default `dashboard`): initial view after login.
  - Added optional `stream_info` block to hide specific fields in the active stream display:
    - `hide_group`
    - `hide_ip`
    - `hide_country`
    - `hide_shared`
    - `hide_duration`
    - `hide_bandwidth`
    - `hide_transferred`
    - `hide_player`
    - `hide_user_comment`
    - `hide_epg`
- **config.yml (`log`)**:
  - Added `runtime_config_report_enabled` (bool, default `false`): enables full runtime config dump at startup.
  - Added `runtime_config_report_format` (`yaml` | `json`, default `yaml`): output format for the runtime config report.
- **source.yml (`providers`)**:
  - Added `provider_url_selection_policy` (`resume_last_working` | `restart_from_first`, default `resume_last_working`):
    controls URL selection behavior after provider failover.

- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy`)**:
  - Added `qos_aggregation` (optional) with:
    - `enabled` (`bool`)
    - `interval_secs` (`u64`)
- **config.yml (`reverse_proxy.geoip`)**:
  - Added `unavailable_policy` (`deny` | `allow`, default `deny`).
  - `deny` keeps country-based `network_access` restrictions closed when GeoIP is disabled, missing, or not loaded.
  - `allow` is an explicit risk acceptance that allows country-based `network_access` restrictions only when GeoIP is
    unavailable. CIDR-only misses, unknown countries, and country mismatches still deny.
- **api-proxy.yml (`user.credentials[].network_access`)**:
  - Added optional per-user network restrictions:
    - `allowed_networks`: CIDR ranges such as `192.168.0.0/16` or `10.0.0.1/32`.
    - `allowed_countries`: ISO-style country codes resolved through GeoIP.
  - The rules use OR semantics: any matching CIDR or country allows the request.

## 🛠 Maintenance

- **Playlist curation now has a dedicated capability boundary**: matching, ordering, and virtual-category projection
  live in the source-neutral `tuliprox-curation` crate, while Trakt HTTP/JSON handling translates records at the edge.
  Existing `output[].trakt` configuration, category identity, matching behavior, and partial-success semantics remain
  unchanged.

- **`AdmissionRequest` bundles the request-scoped admission arguments**: five functions each threaded the same ten
  positional parameters, three of them consecutive bare `bool`s (`use_session_admission`, then
  `activate_unbound_session` a slot later). Call sites read `..., true, Some(session_token), true, guard)` — a shape
  where transposing two arguments still compiles and silently changes which admission check runs. One struct now names
  every field at the call site, and the comment that lived in the parameter list moved onto the field it documents.
  This removes three `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` and one `clippy::too_many_lines`.

- **The empty-admission-strategy-list rule is stated rather than implied**: the resolver matched on
  `admission_strategies.is_some()` and then re-unwrapped with `unwrap_or_default()`, so the guard proved something the
  body checked again — and the rule that an explicitly empty list suppresses the `grace_period_millis` fallback while an
  absent list does not was implicit in the arm ordering. Rewritten as a match on `as_ref()` with the distinction
  spelled out. `Some(vec![])` still means "no strategies", not "fall back to grace".

- **Dead admission parameter and a doc block that described a decision that does not exist**: the strategy loop took a
  `kind_for_exhausted` it never read (both callers construct the exhausted result themselves), and the doc block on the
  post-grace fallback listed a `Deny` rule although `AdmissionDecision` only has `NoMatch`, `Grace` and `Evict`.

- **The documented event table is complete again**: eight events registered by the user-lifecycle and auth work —
  `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`, the four `auth.*` decisions and `stream.probe.failed` — were never
  given a row, so `every_registered_event_appears_in_the_docs_table` had been failing since before those events landed.
  The rows are generated from the descriptors, so severity and description match the registry exactly. A run of
  twenty-seven spaces left inside the `stream.probe.failed` description by a collapsed wrapped literal is normalised in
  the registry and the table together.

- **The notification bridge stays a routing table**: fourteen new events left `to_notification` doing its own wording
  inline, at 213 lines. Each event's wording moved into a `*_notification` builder beside the three that already
  existed, so the match is one arm per variant with no logic in it, and the "... N more not listed" wording has one home
  shared by both events that carry sampled lists rather than a copy in each.

- **`EventBusStats::Default` is hand-written**: the taxonomy crossed 32 kinds, and the derived `Default` for arrays
  stops there.

- Moved provider-specific M3U, Xtream and Stalker protocol code from the generic utility namespace into dedicated IPTV
  modules.

- **B+Tree v3 persistence engine**:
  - Consolidated the facade, v2 compatibility reader, v3 engine, migration, WAL, sorted index, and stress tests under
    `backend/btree/src/`.
  - Added checksummed 4 KiB Slotted Pages, WAL-before-data in-place updates, verified atomic full replacement, typed
    v1/v2 startup migration, identity-bound sorted indexes, and corruption-reporting iterators.
  - Reused mmap mappings, page validation, and decoded internal routes across cheap `BPlusTreeQuery` clones while
    retaining request-local scratch buffers.
  - Kept stored values up to 512 bytes inline, avoiding one mostly empty 4 KiB overflow page per typical Xtream/M3U
    playlist entry and restoring compact full-scan behavior.
  - Playlist APIs now coalesce small M3U, Xtream, HDHomeRun, XMLTV, JSON, and CBOR fragments into bounded 64 KiB
    response chunks instead of emitting one HTTP body frame per entry.
  - Corrupt individual B+Tree values are logged and skipped when the iterator can safely continue; database-open and
    worker failures remain visible, and failed input-cache opens no longer replace existing Xtream persistence.
  - Classified B+Tree read failures as repository errors
  - Opening a corrupt existing Library database no longer silently produces an empty Library.
- **Shared `FieldWrapper` For Form Inputs**:
  - Extracted the repeated label / field-id / `tp__input-wrapper` scaffolding from the `Input`, `NumberInput`, and
    `TextArea` primitives into a single shared `FieldWrapper` component, reducing duplication while keeping the
    rendered markup and behavior unchanged.

- **Units and identity in the type system**: several classes of value that were bare integers or strings now carry their
  meaning in their type, with no change to the serialized form and no config migration:
  - `Millis` / `Secs` for HLS timing config, applied through the DTO → runtime hop rather than unwrapped at the
    boundary, so a millisecond value can no longer reach a seconds parameter — the two sat two lines apart in the same
    struct as bare `u64`s, and `cache_duration` and `session_idle_timeout` did not carry their unit in their names at
    all.
  - `Bytes` for resolved byte sizes, so a parsed size is distinguishable from any other `u64` and a runtime struct can
    no longer hold an unparsed size by accident.
  - `VirtualId` and `ProviderId` as real newtypes. The same store is keyed by a virtual id on the target path and a
    provider id on the input path, and nothing stopped a lookup in one key space using an id from the other. There is
    deliberately no implicit conversion in either direction. On-disk compatibility is pinned by a B+Tree codec test
    asserting a transparent newtype over `u32` encodes byte-for-byte identically and cross-reads in both directions, so
    existing databases are unaffected and there is no migration.
  - The Xtream store's key space is now a type parameter rather than a runtime tag matched per item inside the insert
    loop, so the two key spaces can no longer be swapped by passing the wrong enum variant.

- **One shape for config preparation and error reporting**:
  - A `Prepare` trait replaces ~98 inherent `prepare`/`validate` methods that had no agreed signature — some took
    nothing, some pattern templates, some a storage dir, a port or a boolean, returning four different result types.
    Because the shape was invisible, the recursive walk was hand-written at every level and a config struct that forgot
    to call its children failed silently at runtime rather than at compile time. Dispatch stays entirely static.
  - `TuliproxError` splits into a `Copy` kind and a message. All 50 variants carried exactly one string, so it was a
    category tag beside a message encoded as an enum — costing a 50-arm accessor and a second 50-name list that had to
    be kept in sync by hand, and making the category impossible to compare, store or return on its own. The 755
    construction sites are untouched.
  - A `Clock` seam replaces 14 character-for-character copies of `current_time_millis` across two crates. It is meant to
    be held as a generic parameter defaulted to a zero-sized type, never as a trait object; a test asserts owning one
    leaves a struct's layout unchanged.

- **Single-sourced relations that were written down more than once**:
  - The item-type-to-cluster relation existed in three places with nothing keeping them in agreement, and its conversion
    was total while returning a `Result` — a phantom error that had spread defensive fallbacks to 17 call sites across
    four crates. All 17 drop their fallback.
  - Genre access was a four-arm match written out five times; it is now two methods.
  - The mapper and counter field allow-lists are typed rather than string lists, which also collapsed a duplicated EPG
    channel-id entry that existed only to cover both accepted spellings.
  - Three macros generating by-name field accessors are gone. One of them — an ~80-line prefix-matched lookup for Xtream
    cover and backdrop resources — turned out to have no callers at all and was deleted rather than ported.

- **Provider fetches have one shape**: the three provider families were modelled three different ways and each returned
  a differently-shaped tuple, so the dispatcher was a ninety-line match whose eight arms hand-assembled a six-element
  tuple, padding fields their provider does not produce with literal zeros and then destructuring by position — two of
  the six elements were dead on arrival. One trait with one named result type replaces it, dispatch stays a statically
  dispatched match, and the two unsupported input types now carry their reason.

- **Stalker client seams and test coverage**: the Stalker API client owned its HTTP client and read the system clock
  directly, which put every interesting decision it makes behind a live portal — the module docs conceded outright that
  no HTTP requests are issued from unit tests. Both are now type parameters defaulted to the production implementation,
  neither introducing a vtable or an allocation. Nine tests now cover paths that previously had no way to be reached at
  all, including a portal refusal hidden inside a `200 OK`, an over-cap body being refused rather than buffered,
  endpoint-candidate failover in priority order, and a session ageing past its TTL on a clock that can be advanced.
  Expiry rules — session staleness, cookie `Max-Age`, and the Xtream account-expiry warning — now take the instant as a
  parameter rather than reading the clock, so the cookie boundary is asserted at the exact second it flips and the
  three-day expiry window has tests for all three branches instead of none.

- **Stalker page arithmetic has one home**: the rule for "is this the last catalog page" was written out four times and
  two copies had already drifted in how they measure progress against the advertised total. The two per-row-type page
  parsers collapse into one generic walk as well; they differed only in the row type and both hand-rolled the same four
  envelope shapes.

- **`exec_processing` takes a run object**: it had twelve positional parameters, seven of them `Option`, so a call site
  was a wall of `None`s where the reader had to count commas and the compiler could not catch two same-typed arguments
  being swapped. The CLI path is now a single constructor call.

- **Workspace dependency edges reduced from 78 to 75**: the DVR crate no longer depends on the streaming-session
  runtime (the event bus was the only thing it wanted, and a trait bound is not a dependency), and neither the IPTV nor
  the processing crate depends on the messaging crate any more — emitting an event is not knowing how it is delivered.

## 3.3.0 (2026-04-02)

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes 3.3.0

- `working_dir` in `config.yml` renamed to `storage_dir`.
- **Global Input Definitions**: To align input definitions with the SourceEditor, inputs are now defined globally in the `inputs` section of the
  config file. Each source can reference one or more inputs by their name in the `inputs` attribute.
- **Data Format Migration**: Due to heavy refactoring, the old data format is invalid. You need to clean your `data` folder and update the playlists.
- **B+Tree Storage Format**: Storage format has changed to a more efficient Slotted Page architecture.
  - **Index optimization**: Added index to B+Tree to accelerate queries without tree traversal.
  - **TargetIdMapping Optimization**: Refactored to use disk-based B+Tree operations, eliminating startup latency.
  - **B+Tree Header Metadata**: Implemented efficient `BPlusTreeMetadata` Enum to persist `VirtualId` counter directly in the database header.
  - **Fast Initialization**: `TargetIdMapping` now conditionally loads the tree, achieving near-instant startup for established databases.
- **Configuration Renames**:
  - `threads` attribute in `config.yml` renamed to `process_parallel` (boolean).
  - Added mandatory `rewrite_secret` to `reverse_proxy` config for stable resource URLs.
  - Removed `forced_retry_interval_secs`.
  - FFprobe settings moved from `video.*` to `metadata_update.ffprobe.*`.
  - `metadata_update.ffprobe.analyze_duration` and `metadata_update.ffprobe.live_analyze_duration` now require explicit unit suffixes (`s|m|h|d`).
  - **`library.metadata.path` moved to `metadata_update.cache_path`** (default `metadata`).
    The TMDB cache is now shared across all metadata resolution paths (Xtream VOD/Series and local library).
    Remove `path` from `library.metadata` in your `config.yml` and set it under `metadata_update` instead:

    ```yaml
    # Before
    library:
      metadata:
        path: /data/library_metadata
        fallback_to_filename: true
    ```

    ```yaml
    # After
    metadata_update:
      cache_path: /data/library_metadata  # moved here

    library:
      metadata:
        fallback_to_filename: true
    ```
  
- **Input Batch URL Scheme**: Batch input URLs now use the `batch://` scheme instead of `file://`.
  `file://` is no longer accepted for batch CSV definitions. Update your `source.yml`:

    ```yaml
    # Before
    inputs:
      - type: xtream_batch
        url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/batch.csv'
    ```

    ```yaml
    # After
    inputs:
      - type: xtream_batch
        url: 'batch:///home/tuliprox/config/batch.csv'
    ```

  Local paths without a scheme (`/path/file.csv`, `./file.csv`) continue to work.
  The `batch://` scheme clearly distinguishes batch alias files from provider `file://` URLs.
- **DNS Resolved Persistence**: `dns.resolved` has been removed from `source.yml` and the `ProviderDnsDto`.
  Resolved IPs are now persisted separately in `{storage_dir}/provider_dns_resolved.json`.
  This eliminates hot-reload interference caused by DNS refresh cycles writing to `source.yml`.
  DNS caches are automatically carried over during config hot-reloads.
- **Input Batch Changes**: `name` attribute is now mandatory for input type batch to ensure stable playlist UUIDs.
- **Favorites Redesign**: Replaced implicit `create_alias` with explicit `add_favourite(group_name)` script function.
  - **EpgSmartMatch**: Field `name_prefix` syntax needs to be changed from  `name_prefix: !suffix "."` to `name_prefix: { suffix: "." }`.
  - **Sort**: Sort can now use filter to sort specific entries.

    ```yaml
    
      sort:
        match_as_ascii: true
        rules:
          - target: group
            field: group
            filter: Input ~ "provider_1"
            order: asc
          - target: channel
            field: caption
            filter: Group ~ "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
            order: asc
            sequence:
              - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
              - '(?i)\bHD\b'
              - '(?i)\bSD\b'
      ```

  - Trakt api config field `key` is now `api_key`. Added `user_agent` field to Trakt api config
  - resolve_vod_delay and resolve_series_delay are now merged as resolve_delay, added `probe_live` and `probe_live_interval_hours` for live stream
    probing.

      ```yaml

       # Before (deprecated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_vod_delay: 500
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_series_delay: 2
      ```

      ```yaml

       # After (new consolidated)
       output:
       - type: xtream
         resolve_vod: true
         resolve_series: true
         resolve_delay: 2  # Single delay for all resolution types
       ```

## 🌟 New Features 3.3.0

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Replaced the binary admin/non-admin model with fine-grained, group-based permissions.
  - **14 permissions** across 7 domains (`config`, `source`, `user`, `playlist`, `library`, `system`, `epg`),
    each with independent `.read` and `.write` grants.
  - **Group management** via `groups.txt` — define custom roles (e.g., `viewer`, `source_manager`)
    with specific permission sets.
  - **Extended `user.txt` format** — users can now be assigned to one or more groups
    (`username:hash:group1,group2`). Missing group field defaults to `admin` for backward compatibility.
  - **Compact JWT encoding** — permissions are resolved at login and stored as a `u16` bitmask in JWT claims.
    Backend middleware checks permissions via single-instruction bitwise tests.
  - **Password-version tracking** — `pwd_version` in JWT enables automatic token invalidation when a user's password changes.
  - **Backend permission middleware** — per-route `require_permission()` guards replace the old blanket admin check. The backend is the security boundary.
  - **RBAC management API** — CRUD endpoints for web UI users and groups (`/api/v1/rbac/users`, `/api/v1/rbac/groups`, `/api/v1/rbac/permissions`).
  - **Frontend permission gating** — UI elements (buttons, menu items, views) are cosmetically hidden based on the user's resolved permissions.
  - **RBAC admin panel** — new Web UI page with tabbed user/group management, permission checkbox grid, and write-without-read warnings.
  - **No-access page** — users with zero permissions see a friendly "no access" screen instead of an empty dashboard.
  - **Built-in `admin` group** — reserved, always grants all permissions (`*`), cannot be deleted or modified.
- **User Connection Priority**: API users now carry a `priority` field (type `i8`, nice-style: lower value = higher priority, default `0`, probe `127`).
  When all provider slots are occupied and a higher-priority user connects, the lowest-priority active connection on that provider is
  evicted (oldest first when tied). Only connections with exactly one active listener are eligible for eviction; shared connections
  with multiple listeners are not interrupted. Equal priority never evicts equal priority — the new connection is rejected normally
  (with grace-period rules applied as before). User `max_connections` limits are unaffected.
- **Configurable Probe Priority**: Stream-probe tasks (`probe_live`, `probe_vod`, `probe_series`) now run with a configurable priority
  instead of a fixed internal constant. Set `metadata_update.probe.user_priority` (default `127`, i.e. lowest priority) to control how
  aggressively active users can preempt probe connections.
- **User DB Schema Migration V3**: The `api_user.db` file is automatically upgraded to V3 format (adds `priority` field) on first startup.
  A `.userdb_mergeto_v3` guard file is created so config-driven user merges are skipped while the DB is the authoritative source.
- **Background Metadata Queue**: Metadata resolution (VOD/Series) and stream analysis are now queued per input and processed in the background when
  provider connections are idle. This prevents "No Connections" errors for active users during playlist updates.
- **Stream Probing**: Added support for probing streams (`probe_live|vod|series`) to determine codecs and resolution. This runs as a low-priority
  background task.
- **Discord Notifications**: Support for Discord notifications via webhooks with optional Handlebars templates.
- **Enhanced REST Messaging**: Support for custom HTTP methods, headers, and Handlebars templating.
- **Local Library Module**: Comprehensive local video file scanning and metadata management.
  - Recursive scanning, automatic classification, and NFO/TMDB metadata resolution.
  - Incremental scanning and virtual ID management.
- **Panel API Integration**: Optional integration to renew expired input accounts or provision new accounts to ensure a minimum valid input accounts.
- **Playlist Caching**: Added `cache_duration` to inputs, allowing configurable provider playlist cache times during subsequent updates (e.g., `60s`,
  `5m` `12h`, `1d`).
- **Staged Cluster Source Routing**: Added per-cluster staged routing for Xtream inputs.
  You can now decide cluster-wise whether `live` / `vod` / `series` is loaded from staged input, main input, or skipped.
  Skip flags (`xtream_skip_live|vod|series`) remain highest priority and always force skip.
- **Database Viewer**: New CLI flags `--dbx` and `--dbm` to inspect internal database content.
- **Home Directory Override**: Added `--home` (`-H`) CLI argument to set the base directory for config, data, backup, and downloads.
- **Added `disk_based_processing`**: (boolean, default `false`) to `config.yml`. When enabled, input playlists are processed from disk instead of
  memory.
- **User-Agent `default_user_agent`**: Ensures that outgoing requests always pass a default user agent.
- **FFprobe Integration**: Added capability to probe streams for codec, resolution, HDR (HDR10/HLG/DV), and audio channels using `ffprobe`. Probing
  strictly respects provider connection limits. If no slot is available (considering user limits), the item is skipped to prevent provider bans.
- **Metadata Fallback**: Automatically fetches missing TMDB IDs and release dates via the TMDB API if the provider data is incomplete.
- **Streaming**: Added `grace_period_hold_stream` configuration option to delay stream output until grace period connection checks are completed.
- **Provider Failover & Rotation**: Tuliprox supports robust failover mechanisms for streaming providers.
  You can use the special `provider://<provider_name>/...` URL scheme in your configurations. Tuliprox will automatically resolve this to the current
active URL of the specified provider.
  If the current URL fails (e.g., 5xx error, timeout), Tuliprox automatically rotates to the next available URL for that provider.
  It tracks failures and prevents infinite loops by limiting attempts to the number of available URLs.
- Added `epg_request_timeshift: [-+]hh:mm or TimeZone`, example `Europe/Paris`, `America/New_York`, `-2:30`(-2h30m), `+0:15` (15m), `2` (2h), `:30`
  (30m), `:3` (3m)
- **Extended scheduler** to support `Local Library` scans. Scheduler can now trigger automatic library scans alongside playlist updates.
- **Centralized Pattern Templates**: Added a global template collection that is loaded from `config.yml -> template_path` (file or directory) and shared
  across sources and mappings.
- **Template Backward Compatibility**: Existing inline templates in `source.yml` and `mapping.yml` are still loaded and merged during read/validation.
- **Template-Aware Hot Reload**: File watcher now tracks template files/directories and reapplies sources/mappings when templates change.
- **Setup Validation Improvement**: Setup mode validates source configuration against the global template collection and persists template definitions
  separately.
- Added `-T, --template` to override `template_path` on startup.
- **Metadata Update Runtime Config**: Metadata worker intervals, retry/backoff limits, queue sizing, and probe cooldowns are now configurable through
  a dedicated `metadata_update` config block.
- **Unified Metadata Retry State**: Replaced probe-only retry persistence with a single `metadata_retry_state.db` per input. A single record per
  item now stores retry/cooldown state for `resolve`, `probe`, and `tmdb`.
- **TMDB No-Match Cooldown**: Added explicit TMDB cooldown handling. When TMDB resolve completes successfully but returns no match, TMDB reasons are
  suppressed for that item during cooldown to prevent endless requeue loops.
- **HLS/Catchup Provider Reservations**: Added short-lived provider-account reservations for HLS and catchup playback so follow-up requests can stay
  on the same provider account without holding a real provider slot open between requests. New config fields:
  `reverse_proxy.stream.hls_session_ttl_secs` (default `15`) and `reverse_proxy.stream.catchup_session_ttl_secs` (default `45`).
- **Channel Switch Friendly Reservations**: HLS/catchup reservations can now be taken over immediately by a new stream from the same client identity,
  so channel switching does not have to wait for the reservation TTL to expire.
- **Custom Stream Response Timeout**: Added support to limit how long custom fallback stream responses are served.
  Set `config.custom_stream_response_timeout_secs` to a value `> 0` to auto-stop these streams after N seconds. If unset or `0`, custom responses
  are streamed without timeout.
- Added `reverse_proxy.stream.metrics_enabled` to enable per-stream bandwidth and transferred-bytes metrics in the Web UI streams view.

## 🐛 Fixes 3.3.0

- **Resolve Task Cooldown Persistence**: Resolve retry exhaustion is now persisted and consulted before enqueueing, so unresolved VOD/Series entries
  are no longer recreated on every playlist refresh only to be skipped later in the worker.
- **Probe Handle Capacity Leak**: Fixed provider-slot leaks when internal probe tasks timed out, were dropped, or were preempted. Capacity is now
  released reliably even when the underlying probe task does not complete normally.
- **Immediate Probe Preemption**: Higher-priority stream requests now cancel lower-priority probe tasks immediately instead of leaving a grace window
  where the probe could continue holding upstream resources.
- **Anonymous Socket Cleanup**: Tracked anonymous incoming sockets are now pruned automatically after a TTL so stale UI/API keepalive registrations do
  not remain visible forever in active-socket statistics.

## ⚙️ New Settings 3.3.0

- **config.yml (`web_ui.auth`)**:
  - Added `groupfile` (optional, default: `groups.txt` in same directory as `userfile`): path to the RBAC group definitions file.
- **`user.txt`** (extended format, backward compatible):
  - Format is now `username:argon2_hash[:group1,group2,...]`. The optional third field assigns group memberships.
    Missing third field defaults to the `admin` group for full backward compatibility.
- **`groups.txt`** (new file):
  - Defines permission groups in `group_name:permission1,permission2,...` format.
    The `admin` group is built-in and cannot be defined here. See the configuration docs for the full permission list.
- **api-proxy.yml / Web UI (user)**:
  - Added `priority` (`i8`, default `0`) to user credentials. Lower value = higher priority (nice-style).
    Configurable via Web UI user editor. Negative values are valid and represent higher-than-default priority.
- **config.yml**:
  - Added `custom_stream_response_timeout_secs` (`u32`, default `0`): maximum duration in seconds for custom stream response videos.
    `0` disables the timeout and keeps existing behavior.
  - Added `metadata_update.probe.user_priority` (`i8`, default `127`): priority assigned to probe connections.
    Probe tasks run at the lowest priority by default; reduce this value to give probes more connection access.
  - Added `metadata_update` (optional) with grouped sections: `log`, `resolve`, `probe`, `ffprobe`, `tmdb`.
  - Added `metadata_update.cache_path` (default `metadata`): shared storage directory for TMDB cache and metadata files
    (moved from `library.metadata.path`).
  - Added `metadata_update.no_change_cache_ttl_secs` (default `3600`): TTL in seconds for the no-change
    deduplication cache used by background metadata resolve tasks.
  - Added `metadata_update.tmdb.cooldown` (default `7d`) for successful TMDB no-match cooldown behavior.
  - Added `metadata_update.ffprobe.enabled` (default: false), `metadata_update.ffprobe.timeout`, and ffprobe probe/analyze size settings.
  - `metadata_update.ffprobe.analyze_duration` and `metadata_update.ffprobe.live_analyze_duration` require explicit unit suffixes (`s|m|h|d`).
  - FFprobe settings are configured under `metadata_update.ffprobe` (not under `video`).
  - Added `metadata_update.probe_fairness_resolve_burst` (default `200`) to control fairness between resolve and probe tasks.
    After N consecutive resolve-domain tasks, one pending probe-domain task is prioritized to avoid probe starvation.
  - Added `reverse_proxy.stream.hls_session_ttl_secs` (`u64`, default `15`): keeps a short-lived provider-account reservation for HLS sessions.
  - Added `reverse_proxy.stream.catchup_session_ttl_secs` (`u64`, default `45`): keeps a short-lived provider-account reservation for catchup
    sessions and seek/reconnect flows.
  - Added `template_path` (optional): path to a template file (`template.yml`) or directory (`template.d` style).
- **source.yml (input options)**:
  - Added `resolve_tmdb`: Triggers TMDB lookup if ID is missing.
  - Added `probe_stream`: Triggers ffprobe if technical info is missing.
  - Added `probe_delay`: Delay between probe tasks (default `50` seconds).
  - Added `staged.enabled`: Disables/enables the staged input.
  - Added `staged.live_source`: Selects source for Live cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added `staged.vod_source`: Selects source for VOD cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added `staged.series_source`: Selects source for Series cluster (`staged` | `input` | `skip`).
  - Added staged validation rules:
    - Cluster source rules apply only when `staged.enabled=true`.
    - For Xtream main inputs with staged enabled, at least one cluster source must be `staged`.
    - For staged type `m3u`, `vod_source=staged` and `series_source=staged` are rejected.
- **source.yml (target output)**:
  - Added `probe_live`: Enables background probing for Live TV streams (default disabled).
  - Added `probe_live_interval_hours`: Sets the frequency for re-probing Live TV streams.
  - Added `resolve_background`: Toggles background metadata resolution (default `true`). Set to `false` for blocking, immediate resolution.

## 🛠 Optimizations 3.3.0

- **Quality Tagging**: Generates enhanced filename tags (e.g., `[2160p 4K HEVC HDR TrueHD 7.1]`) for STRM files based on analysis results.
- **Flat Grouping**: When `flat: true` option for STRM output is active, multiple versions (e.g., 4K and 1080p) of the same movie are now safely
  merged over all categories into a single folder based on TMDB ID, compatible with Jellyfin/Emby "Multi-Version" features.

## ⚙️ Engine & Storage Optimizations 3.3.0

- **String Interning**: Implemented `Arc<str>` string interning for playlist items to further reduce memory footprint.
- **Zero-Copy B+Tree Scan**: Implemented zero-copy scanning for B+Tree internal nodes, significantly reducing heap allocations and improving random
  read throughput (up to 96k ops/sec).
- **Optimized Key Lookups**: `XtreamRepository` and `M3uRepository` now use zero-copy queries for `u32` keys, enhancing performance for high-traffic
  endpoints.

- Introduced the **Metadata Update** config tab, with FFprobe controls relocated from **Video** into it.
- **Playlist Explorer Resources**: Channel logos (and non-local episode images) are loaded via authenticated same-origin resource endpoints so HTTP
  upstream assets still render behind HTTPS frontends.
- **Local Library Episode Backgrounds**: Local series episode `movie_image` values are now kept as direct TMDB image URLs in series info documents and
  rendered directly in Playlist Explorer.

- Fixed file length issue in STRM generation
- Fixed empty parentheses issue in series names
- Removed default sorting
- WebSocket now reconnects on disconnect; added WebSocket connection status icon in Web UI
- Added Playlist EPG view with timeline, channels, `now` line, and program details

- fixed active user count
- fixed hls streaming
- more logs sanitized
- added session key for session management
- added sleep timer  `sleep_timer_mins`  to config.yml
- added mapper script builtin function `template` to access template definitions.

```text

   station_prefix = template(concat("US_", station, "_PREFIX")),

```

If we assume the variable `station` contains the value `WINK`,
this script receives the template with the concatenated name `US_WINK_PREFIX` which should be defined in `templates` section,
and assigns it to the variable `station_prefix`.

- Extended STRM export functionality with:
  - Support for various media tools (Kodi, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin), with consideration for recommended naming conventions and file organization.
  - Optional flat directory structure via 'flat' parameter (nested folder structures are not supported by some media scanners).
- Added Trakt support for XC targets

```yaml
      - name: iptv-trakt-example
        output:
          - type: xtream
            skip_live_direct_source: true
            skip_video_direct_source: true
            skip_series_direct_source: true
            resolve_series: false
            resolve_vod: false
            trakt:
              api:
                key: <my Trakt Client ID>
                version: 2
              lists:
                - user: "linaspurinis"
                  list_slug: "top-watched-movies-of-the-week"
                  category_name: "📈 Top Weekly Movies"
                  content_type: "vod"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
                - user: "garycrawfordgc"
                  list_slug: "latest-tv-shows"
                  category_name: "📺 Latest TV Shows"
                  content_type: "series"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
```

## 3.1.3 (2025-06-06)

- Fixed xtream codes series info duplicate fields problem.
- Fixed series info container_extension problem.
- Mapper script can have blocks now.
  For example, you want to write a `if then else` block

```text

  # Maybe there is no station
  station = @Caption ~ "(ABC)"
  match {
     station => {
        # if block
        # station exists
     }
     # optional any match as else block
     _ => {
         # else block
         # station does not exists
     }
  }

```

- New BuiltIn Mapper function `first`. When you use Regular expressions it could be that your match contains multiple results.
  The builtin function `first` returns the first match.

## 3.1.2 (2025-06-02)

- fixed input filter
- fixed epg fuzzy match `match_threshold` default value
- fixed `auto` epg source

## 3.1.1 (2025-05-27)

- fixed m3u api hls handling
- during grace period no data is sent to client.
- splitted config file handling for accurate error messages

## 3.1.0 (2025-05-26)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! mapper refactored, mapping can be written as a script with a custom DSL.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `tags` definition removed from new mapper.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! removed `suffix` and `prefix` from input config. Use mapper with an input filter instead.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! custom_stream_response is now `custom_stream_response_path`. The filename identifies the file inside the path
  - user_account_expired.ts
  - provider_connections_exhausted.ts
  - user_connections_exhausted.ts
  - channel_unavailable.ts
    `user_account_expired.ts`: Tuliprox will return a 403 Forbidden response for any playlist request if the user is expired.
    So this screen will only ever appear if someone tries to directly access a stream URL after their account has expired.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! epg refactored
  - url config is now renamed to sources
  - Added `priority`, priority is `optional`
  - `auto_epg` is now removed, use `url: auto` instead.
  - Added `logo_override` to overwrite logo from epg.

**Note:** The `priority` value determines the importance or order of processing. Lower numbers mean higher priority. That is:
A `priority` of `0` is higher than `1`. **Negative numbers** are allowed and represent even higher priority

```yaml
epg:
  sources:
    - url: "auto"
      priority: -2
      logo_override: true
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1"
      priority: -1
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2"
      priority: 3
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=3"
      priority: 0
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'
```

- Fixed mapper transform capitalize.
- Auto hot reload for `mapping.yml`and `api-proxy.yml`
  To enable set `config_hot_reload: true` in `config.yml`
- Added config.d-style mapping support.
  You can now place multiple mapping files inside a directory like `mapping.d` and specify it using the `-m` option, for example:
  `-m /home/tuliprox/config/mapping.d`
  The files are loaded in **alphanumeric** order.
  **Note:** This is a lexicographic sort — so `m_10.yml` comes before `m_2.yml` unless you name files carefully (e.g., `m_01.yml`, `m_02.yml`, ...,
`m_10.yml`).

- Added `mapping_path` to `config.yml`.
- Added list template for sequences. List templates can only be used for sequences.

```yaml
templates:
  - name: CHAN_SEQ
    value:
      - '(?i)\bUHD\b'
      - '(?i)\bFHD\b'
```

The template can now be used for sequence

```yaml
  sort:
    groups:
      order: asc
    channels:
      - field: caption
        group_pattern: "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
        order: asc
        sequence:
          - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
          - '(?i)\bHD\b'
          - '(?i)\bSD\b'
```

- added `disable_referer_header` to `reverse_proxy` config
  This option, when set to `true`, prevents tuliprox from sending the Referer header in requests made when acting as a reverse proxy. This can be
particularly useful when dealing with certain Xtream Codes providers that might restrict or behave differently based on the Referer header. Default is
`false`.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  disable_referer_header: false
```

## 3.0.0 (2025-05-12)

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! user has now the attribute `ui_enabled` to disable/enable web_ui for user.
  You need to migrate the user db if you have used `use_user_db:true`.
  Set it to `false` run old tuliprox version, then update tuliprox and set `use_user_db:true`and start.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! all docker images have now tuliprox under `/app`
- !BREAKING CHANGE! bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  is now `throttle` and supports units. Allowed units are `KB/s`,`MB/s`,`KiB/s`,`MiB/s`,`kbps`,`mbps`,`Mibps`.
  Default unit is `kbps`.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE!  `log` config `active_clients` renamed to `log_active_user`
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `web_ui config` restructured and added `user_ui_enabled` attribute

```yaml

web_ui:
  enabled: true
  user_ui_enabled: true
  path:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    issuer: tuliprox
    secret: ef9ab256a8c0abe5de92c2e05ca92baa810472ab702ff1674e9248308ceeec92
    userfile: user.txt

```

- `grace_period_millis` default set to 300 milliseconds.
- `grace_period_timeout_secs` default set to 2 seconds.
- Fixed user grace period
- Added `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` to `reverse_proxy.stream` config. When grace_period granted,
  until the `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` elapses no grace_period is granted again.
- Added `method` attribute to input config. It can be set to `GET` or `POST`.
- Added optional `auto_epg` field to `input epg config` for auto-generating provider epg link.
- Added rate limiting per IP. The burst_size defines the initial number of available connections,
  while period_millis specifies the interval at which one connection is replenished.
  If behind a proxy `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` or `forwarded` should be set as header.
  The configuration below allows up to 10 connections initially and then replenishes 1 connection every 500 milliseconds.

```yaml

reverse_proxy:
  rate_limit:
    enabled: true
    period_millis: 500
    burst_size: 10

```

- Multi epg processing/optimization, auto guessing/assigning epg id's
- Fixed hls redirect url issue
- Added `force_redirect` to target config options. valid options are `live`, `vod`, `series`

```yaml

 options: {ignore_logo: false, share_live_streams: false, force_redirect: [vod, series]}

```

```yaml

epg:
  url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'

```

`match_threshold`is optional and if not set 80.
`best_match_threshold` is optional and if not set 99.
`name_prefix` can be `ignore`, `suffix`, `prefix`. For `suffix` and `prefix` you need to define a concat string.
`strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]`  this is the defualt
`normalize_regex: [^a-zA-Z0-9\-]`   is the default

```yaml

# single epg

url: 'https://localhost.com/epg.xml'

```

```yaml

# multi local file  epg

url: ['file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg.xml', 'file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg2.xml']

```

```yaml

# multi url  epg

url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']

```

- Added `strip` to input for auto epg matching, if not given `["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]` is default
  When no matching epg_id is found, the display name is used to match a channel name. The given strings are stripped to get a better match.
- Fixed chno assignment issue
- Redirect Proxy provider cycle implemented (m3u playlist only cycles when output param `mask_redirect_url` is set).
- Reverse Proxy mode for user can now be a subset
  - `reverse`           -> all reverse
  - `reverse[live]`     -> only live reverse, vod and series redirect
  - `reverse[live,vod]` -> series redirect, others reverse
- `/status` api endpoint moved to  `/api/v1/status` for auth protection
- fixed multi provider VOD seek problem (provider cycle on seek request prevented playback)
- hdhomerun supports now basic auth like <http://user:password@ip:port/lineup.json>
  you need to enable auth in config

```yaml

hdhomerun:
  enabled: true
  auth: true
  devices:
    - name: hdhr1

```

- A new filter field `caption` has been added. This field is used to bypass the `title/name` issue.
  If `caption` is provided, its value is read from `title` if available, otherwise from `name`.
  When setting `caption`, both `title` and `name` are updated.”
- Counter has now an attribute `padding`. Which fills the number like 001.
- Added proxy configuration for all outgoing requests in `config.yml`. supported http, https, socks5 proxies.

```yaml

proxy:
  url: socks5://192.168.1.6:8123
  username: uname  # <- optional basic auth
  password: secret # <- optional basic auth

```

- Added support for regular expression-based sequence sorting.
  You can now sort both groups and channels using custom regex sequences.

```yaml
sort:
  groups:
  order: asc
  sequence:
    - '^Freetv'
    - '^Shopping'
    - '^Entertainment'
    - '^Sunrise'
  channels:
    - field: caption
      group_pattern: '^Freetv'
      order: asc
      sequence:
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bUHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bFHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bSD\b'
```

In the example above, groups are sorted based on the specified sequence.
Channels within the `Freetv` group are first sorted by `quality` (as matched by the regex sequence), and then by the `captured prefix`.

To sort by specific parts of the content, use named capture groups such as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, etc.
The numeric suffix indicates the priority: `c1` is evaluated first, followed by `c2`, and so on.

- Added ip check config
  - url # URL that may return both IPv4 and IPv6 in one response
  - url_ipv4 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv4
  - url_ipv6 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv6
  - pattern_ipv4 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv4
  - pattern_ipv6 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv6

```yaml

ipcheck:
  url_ipv4: https://ipinfo.io/ip

```

## 2.2.5 (2025-03-27)

- fixed web ui playlist regexp search
- added `web_ui_path` to `config.yml`
- added grace period `grace_period_millis`  attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  If you have a provider or a user where the max_connection attribute is greater than 0,
  a grace period can be given during the switchover.
  If this period is set too short, it may result in access being denied in some cases.
  The default is 1000 milliseconds (1sec).
- added bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`

| Resolution      |Framerate| Bitrate (kbps) | Quality     |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
|480p (854x480)   |  30 fps | 819–2.457      | Low-Quality |
|720p (1280x720)  |  30 fps | 2.457–5.737    | HD-Streams  |
|1080p (1920x1080)|  30 fps | 5.737–12.288   | Full-HD     |
|4K (3840x2160)   |  30 fps | 20.480–49.152  | Ultra-HD    |

## 2.2.4 (2025-03-24)

- fixed `connect_timeout_secs:0` prevents connection initiation issue.
- fixed `hdhomerun` and `strm` config check for non-existing username.
- "Breaking CHANGE! Moved `connect_timeout_secs` is global timeout and defiend in config root and not `reverse_proxy.stream`.

## 2.2.3 (2025-03-23)

- variable resolving for config files now for all settings
- hls reverse proxy implemented
- dash redirect implemented (reverse proxy not supported)
- !BREAKING CHANGE! `channel_unavailable_file` is now under `custom_stream_response`,
- New custom streams `user_connections_exhausted` and `provider_connections_exhausted`added.

```yaml

custom_stream_response:
  channel_unavailable: /home/tuliprox/resources/channel_unavailable.ts
  user_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/user_connections_exhausted.ts
  provider_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/provider_connections_exhausted.ts

```

- input alias definition for same provider with same content but different credentials

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream
      name: my_provider
      url: 'http://provider.net'
      username: xyz
      password: secret1
      aliases:
        - name: my_provider_2
          url: 'http://provider.net'
          username: abcd
          password: secret2
    targets:
      - name: test
```

Input aliases can be defined as batches in csv files with `;` separator.
There are 2 batch input types  `xtream_batch` and `m3u_batch`.
`XtreamBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: xtream_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
      - name: test
```

```csv

#name;username;password;url;max_connections;priority
my_provider_1;user1;password1;http://my_provider_1.com:80;1;0
my_provider_2;user2;password2;http://my_provider_2.com:8080;1;0

```

`M3uBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
  - inputs:
    - type: m3u_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
    targets:
    - name: test
```

```csv

#url;max_connections;priority
http://my_provider_1.com:80/get_php?username=user1&password=password1;1;0
http://my_provider_2.com:8080/get_php?username=user2&password=password2;1;0

```

The Fields `max_connections` and `priority`are optional.
`max_connections`  will be set default to `1`. This is different from yaml config where the default is `0=unlimited`

- added two options to reverse proxy config `forced_retry_interval_secs` and `connect_timeout_secs`
  `forced_retry_interval_secs` forces every x seconds a reconnect to the provider,
  `connect_timeout_secs` tries only x seconds for connection, if not successfully starts a retry.

## 2.2.2 (2025-03-12)

- !BREAKING CHANGE! Target options moved to specific target output definitions.

target `options`:

- `ignore_logo`: `true`|`false`,
- `share_live_streams`: `true`|`false`,
- `remove_duplicates`: `true`|`false`,

target output type `xtream`:

- `skip_live_direct_source`: `true`|`false`,
- `skip_video_direct_source`: `true`|`false`,
- `skip_series_direct_source`: `true`|`false`,
- `resolve_series`: `true`|`false`,
- `resolve_series_delay`: seconds,
- `resolve_vod`: `true`|`false`,
- `resolve_vod_delay`: `true`|`false`,

target output type `m3u`:

- `filename`: *optional*
- `include_type_in_url`: `true`|`false`,
- `mask_redirect_url`: `true`|`false`,

target output type `strm`:

- `underscore_whitespace`: `true`|`false`,
- `cleanup`: `true`|`false`,
- `kodi_style`: `true`|`false`,
- `strm_props`: *optional*,  list of strings,

target output type `hdhomerun`:

- `device`: *mandatory*,
- `username`: *mandatory*,
- `use_output`: *optional*, `m3u`|`xtream`

Example:

```yaml
targets:
  - name: xc_m3u
    output:
      - type: xtream
        skip_live_direct_source: true,
        skip_video_direct_source: true,
      - type: m3u
      - type: strm
        directory: /tmp/kodi
      - type: hdhomerun
        username: hdhruser
        device: hdhr1
        use_output: xtream
    options: {ignore_logo: false, share_live_streams: true, remove_duplicates: false}
```

- The Web UI now includes a login feature for playlist users, allowing them to set their groups for filtering and managing their own bouquet of
  groups.
  The playlist user can login with his credentials and can select the desired groups for his playlist.
- Added `user_config_dir` to `config.yml`. It is the storage path for user configurations (f.e. bouquets).
- New Filter field `input` can be used along `name`, `group`, `title`, `url` and `type`. Input is a `regexp` filter. `input ~ "provider\-\d+"`
- New option `use_user_db` in `api-proxy.yml`. The Playlist Users are stored inside the config file `api-proxy.yml`. When you set this option to
  `true`
  the user are stored in a db file. This is a better choice if you have a lot of users. If you have only a few let it default to `false`
- WebUI playlist browser with tree and gallery mode. Explore self hosted and provider playlists in browser.
- Added HdHomeRun tuner target for use with Plex/Emby/Jellyfin

## 2.2.1 (2025-02-14)

- Added more info to `/status`.
- Refactored unavailable channel replacement streaming.
- Fixed catch up saving.
- Updated readme for creation of unavailable channel video file with ffmpeg for mobiles.
- refactored stream sharing.

## 2.2.0 (2025-02-11)

- !BREAKING CHANGE!  unique `input` `name` is now mandatory, because rearranging the `source.yml` could lead to wrong results without a playlist
  update.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `log_sanitize_sensitive_info`  is now under `log` section  as `sanitize_sensitive_info`
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! uuid generation for entries changed to `input.name` + `stream_id`. Virtual id mapping changed. The new Virtual id is not a
  sequence anymore.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `api-proxy.yml`  server config changed.

```yaml
server:
  - name: default
    protocol: http
    host: 192.169.1.9
    port: '8901'
    timezone: Europe/Paris
    message: Welcome to tuliprox
  - name: external
    protocol: https
    host: tuliprox.mydomain.tv
    port: '443'
    timezone: Europe/Paris
    message: Welcome to tuliprox
    path: tuliprox
```

- Added Active clients count (for reverse proxy mode users) which is now displayed in `/status`  and can be logged with setting
  `active_clients: true` under `log`section in `config.yml`
- Fixed iptv player using live tv stream without `/live/` context.
- Added `log_level` to `log` config. Priority:  CLI-Argument, Env-Var, Config, Default(`info`)

```yaml

log:
  sanitize_sensitive_info: false
  active_clients: true
  log_level: debug
update_on_boot: false
web_ui_enabled: true

```

- Added new option to `input` `xtream_live_stream_without_extension`. Default is `false`.  Some providers don't like `.ts`  extension, some providers
  need it.
  Now you can disable or enable it for a provider.
- Aded new option to `input` `xtream_live_stream_use_prefix`.. Default is `true`.  Some providers don't like `/live/`  prefix for streams, some
  providers need it.
  Now you can disable or enable it for a provider.
- Added `path` to `api-proxy.yml` server config for simpler front reverse-proxy configuration (like nginx)
- added `hlsr` handling.
- fixed mapper counter not incrementing.
- adding `&type=m3u_plus` at the end of an `m3u` url wil trigger a download. Without it will only stream the result.
- `kodi` `strm` generation, does not delete root directory, avoids unchanged file creations.
  `strm` files now o get timestamp from `addedd`property if exists.
- shared live stream implementation refactored.
- added optional user properties: `max_connections`, `status`, `exp_date` (expiration date as unix seconds).
  If they exist they are checked when `config.yml` `user_access_control` set to true., if you don't need them remove this fields from `api-proxy.yml`
  Added option in `config.yml` the option `user_access_control` to activate the checks. Default is false.
- Added option `channel_unavailable_file` in `config.yml`. If a provider stream is not available this file content is send instead.

```yaml

update_on_boot: false
web_ui_enabled: true
channel_unavailable_file: /freeze_frame.ts

```

## 2.1.3 (2025-01-26)

- Hotfix 2.1.2, forgot to update the stream api code.

## 2.1.2 (2025-01-26)

- `Strm` output has an additional option `strm_props`. These props are written to the strm file.
  You can add properties like `#KODIPROP:seekable=true|false`, `#KODIPROP:inputstream=inputstream.ffmpeg` or `"#KODIPROP:http-reconnect=true`.
- Fixed xtream affix-processed output.
- `log_sanitize_sensitive_info`  added to `config.yml`. Default is `true`.
- added `resource_rewrite_disabled` to `reverse_proxy` config to disable resource url rewrite.
- Fixed series redirect proxy mode.
- Added `pushover.net` config to messaging.

```yaml

messaging:
  pushover:
    token: _required_
    user: _required_
    url: `optional`, default is https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json

```

## 2.1.1 (2025-01-19)
