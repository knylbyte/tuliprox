# Changelog
# 3.3.0 (2025-11-xx)
- Avoid blocking the runtime when warming cache
- Normalize FileLockManager paths so aliases share the same lock
- Use async file operations for playlist persistence to avoid blocking async paths
- Async persist cache write pipe so response caching no longer blocks the async runtime
- M3U playlist exports now stream async to keep the runtime responsive
- Shared stream burst buffer zero copy data buffer to reduce memory usage.
- Added detailed shared-stream/buffer/provider logging to trace lag, cache persistence, and session/provider lifecycle events.
- Connection registration failures now trigger an explicit disconnect so zombie sockets don’t linger.
- Shared stream shutdown now drops registry locks before releasing provider handles to prevent cross-lock stalls.


# 3.2.0 (2025-11-14)
- Added `name` attribute to Staged Input.
- Real-time active provider connection monitoring (dashboard + websocket)
- Source editor: block selection, batch-mode UI and automatic layout
- Fixed SSL certificate field binding in configuration view
- More robust connection-state and provider-handle management
- Streamlined event notifications and provider-count reporting
- Added configurable `reverse_proxy.resource_retry` (UI + server) to tune max attempts, base delay, and exponential backoff multiplier for proxied resources.
- Multi Strm outputs with same type is now allowed.
- Added new mapper function `pad(text | number, number, char, optional position: "<" | ">" | "^")`
- Added new mapper function `format` for simple in-text replacement like `format("Hello {}! Hello {}!", "Bob", "World")`
- Added `reverse_proxy.stream.shared_burst_buffer_mb` to control shared-stream burst buffer size (default 12 MB).
- Added `movie` as alias for `vod` for type filter. You can now use `Type = movie` as an alternative to `Type = vod`.
- Fixed file locks to avoid race conditions on file operations

# 3.1.8 (2025-11-06)
- Fixed HLS streaming issues caused by session eviction and incorrect headers.
- Catchup stream fix cycling through multiple providers on play.
- Custom streams fix and update webui stream info
- Added TimeZone to `epg_timeshift: [-+]hh:mm or TimeZone`, example `Europe/Paris`, `America/New_York`, `-2:30`(-2h30m), `+0:15` (15m), `2` (2h), `:30` (30m), `:3` (3m)
  If you use TimeZone the timeshift will change on Summer/Winter time if its applied in the TZ.
- Fixed: Mappings now automatically reload and reapply after configuration changes, preventing stale settings.
- Search in Playlist Explorer now returns groups instead of matching flat channel list.
- Added `use_memory_cache` attribute to target definition to hold playlist in memory to reduce disc access.
  Placing playlist into memory causes more RAM usage but reduces disk access.
- Added optional `filter` attribute to Output (except HDHomerun-Output).
  Output filters are applied after all transformations have been performed, therefore, all filter contents must refer to the final state of the playlist.
- Added burst buffer to shared stream
- Telegram message thread support. thread id can now be appended to chat-id like `chat-id:thread-id`.
- Telegram supports markdown generation for structured json messages. simply set `markdown: true` in telegram config.
- Added User-Stream-Connections Table to WebUI
- Enhanced STRM output filenames to include detailed media quality info (e.g., 4K, HDR, x265, 5.1) for easy version distinction.
- Added standardized SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) and the Proprietary HDHomeRun UDP Discovery Protocol (Port 65001)
- Fixed some session handling issue
- added `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
  Allows removing selected headers before forwarding requests when acting as a reverse proxy. Configure removal of the referer header, all `X-*` headers, and additional custom headers.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `disble_referer_header` is now part of `reverse_proxy.disabled_header` configuration
- UserTable: Copy credentials to clipboard from user table
- UserTable: Kick user action from streams table
- UserTable: Auto-generated username/password for new proxy users

# 3.1.7 (2025-10-10)
- Added Dark/Bright theme switch
- Resource proxy retries failed requests up to three times and respects the `Retry-After` header (falls back to 100 ms wait)
  to reduce transient HTTP errors (400, 408, 425, 429, 5xx)
- Added `accept_insecure_ssl_certificates` option in `config.yml` (for serving images over HTTPS without a valid SSL certificate)
- VOD streams now use tmdbid from `get_vod_streams` if available, removing the need for `resolve_vod` in STRM generation
- Fixed file length issue in STRM generation
- Fixed empty parentheses issue in series names
- Removed default sorting
- WebSocket now reconnects on disconnect; added WebSocket connection status icon in Web UI
- Added Playlist EPG view with timeline, channels, `now` line, and program details
- EPG data can now be fetched from selected targets and custom URLs
- Faster, more reliable EPG loading via streaming and asynchronous processing, with reduced memory usage and better support for large or compressed guides.
- Invalid EPG text data fix
- Added new sidebar entry and icon for quick EPG access
- Added CBOR (binary JSON) support for large API data

# 3.1.6 (2025-09-01)
- EPG Config View added
- Fixed loading users for WebUI from user DB
- Fixed auto EPG for batch inputs
- Fixed EPG URL prepare
- Content Security Policies configurable via config, default OFF
- WebUI Config View editor for config.yml added

# 3.1.5 (2025-08-14)
- Hot reload for config
- New WebUI (currently only readonly)
- Fixed shared stream provider connection count
- Added hanging client connection release
- Added `replace` built-in function for mapper scripts
- Added `token_ttl_mins` to web_auth config to define auth token expiration duration.
- Staged sources. Side-loading playlist. Load from staged, serve from provider.
- Fixed proxy config
- Added Content Security Policy to WebUI

# 3.1.4 (2025-06-17)
- share live stream refactored
- fixed active user count
- fixed hls streaming
- more logs sanitized
- added session key for session management
- added sleep timer  `sleep_timer_mins`  to config.yml
- added mapper script builtin function `template` to access template definitions.
```
   station_prefix = template(concat("US_", station, "_PREFIX")),
```
If we assume the variable `station` contains the value `WINK`,
this script receives the template with the concatenated name `US_WINK_PREFIX` which should be defined in `templates` section,
and assigns it to the variable `station_prefix`.
- Extended STRM export functionality with:
  - Support for various media tools (Kodi, Plex, Emby, Jellyfin), with consideration for recommended naming conventions and file organization.
  - Optional flat directory structure via 'flat' parameter (nested folder structures are not supported by some media scanners).
- Added Trakt support for XC targets
```yaml
      - name: iptv-trakt-example
        output:
          - type: xtream
            skip_live_direct_source: true
            skip_video_direct_source: true
            skip_series_direct_source: true
            resolve_series: false
            resolve_vod: false
            trakt:
              api:
                key: <my private trakt api key>
                version: 2
              lists:
                - user: "linaspurinis"
                  list_slug: "top-watched-movies-of-the-week"
                  category_name: "📈 Top Weekly Movies"
                  content_type: "vod"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
                - user: "garycrawfordgc"
                  list_slug: "latest-tv-shows"
                  category_name: "📺 Latest TV Shows"
                  content_type: "series"
                  fuzzy_match_threshold: 80
```

# 3.1.3 (2025-06-06)
- Fixed xtream codes series info duplicate fields problem.
- Fixed series info container_extension problem.
- Mapper script can have blocks now.
  For example, you want to write a `if then else` block
```
  # Maybe there is no station
  station = @Caption ~ "(ABC)"
  match {
     station => {
        # if block
        # station exists
     }
     # optional any match as else block
     _ => {
         # else block
         # station does not exists
     } 
  }
```
- New BuiltIn Mapper function `first`. When you use Regular expressions it could be that your match contains multiple results.
  The builtin function `first` returns the first match.

# 3.1.2 (2025-06-02)
- fixed input filter
- fixed epg fuzzy match `match_threshold` default value
- fixed `auto` epg source

# 3.1.1 (2025-05-27)
- fixed m3u api hls handling
- during grace period no data is sent to client.
- splitted config file handling for accurate error messages

# 3.1.0 (2025-05-26)
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! mapper refactored, mapping can be written as a script with a custom DSL.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `tags` definition removed from new mapper.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! removed `suffix` and `prefix` from input config. Use mapper with an input filter instead.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! custom_stream_response is now `custom_stream_response_path`. The filename identifies the file inside the path
  - user_account_expired.ts
  - provider_connections_exhausted.ts
  - user_connections_exhausted.ts
  - channel_unavailable.ts
    `user_account_expired.ts`: Tuliprox will return a 403 Forbidden response for any playlist request if the user is expired.
    So this screen will only ever appear if someone tries to directly access a stream URL after their account has expired.

- !BREAKING_CHANGE! epg refactored
  - url config is now renamed to sources
  - Added `priority`, priority is `optional`
  - `auto_epg` is now removed, use `url: auto` instead.
  - Added `logo_override` to overwrite logo from epg.

**Note:** The `priority` value determines the importance or order of processing. Lower numbers mean higher priority. That is:
A `priority` of `0` is higher than `1`. **Negative numbers** are allowed and represent even higher priority

```yaml
epg:
  sources:
    - url: "auto"
      priority: -2
      logo_override: true
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1"
      priority: -1
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2"
      priority: 3
    - url: "http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=3"
      priority: 0
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'
```

- Fixed mapper transform capitalize.
- Auto hot reload for `mapping.yml`and `api_proxy.yml`
  To enable set `config_hot_reload: true` in `config.yml`
- Added config.d-style mapping support.
  You can now place multiple mapping files inside a directory like `mapping.d` and specify it using the `-m` option, for example:
  `-m /home/tuliprox/config/mapping.d`
  The files are loaded in **alphanumeric** order.
  **Note:** This is a lexicographic sort — so `m_10.yml` comes before `m_2.yml` unless you name files carefully (e.g., `m_01.yml`, `m_02.yml`, ..., `m_10.yml`).
- Added `mapping_path` to `config.yml`.

- Added list template for sequences. List templates can only be used for sequences.
```yaml
templates:
  - name: CHAN_SEQ
    value:
      - '(?i)\bUHD\b'
      - '(?i)\bFHD\b'
```

The template can now be used for sequence
```yaml
  sort:
    groups:
      order: asc
    channels:
      - field: caption
        group_pattern: "!US_TNT_ENTERTAIN!"
        order: asc
        sequence:
          - "!CHAN_SEQ!"
          - '(?i)\bHD\b'
          - '(?i)\bSD\b'
```
- added `disable_referer_header` to `reverse_proxy` config
  This option, when set to `true`, prevents tuliprox from sending the Referer header in requests made when acting as a reverse proxy. This can be particularly useful when dealing with certain Xtream Codes providers that might restrict or behave differently based on the Referer header. Default is `false`.

```yaml
reverse_proxy:
  disable_referer_header: false 
```

# 3.0.0 (2025-05-12)
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! user has now the attribute `ui_enabled` to disable/enable web_ui for user.
  You need to migrate the user db if you have used `use_user_db:true`.
  Set it to `false` run old tuliprox version, then update tuliprox and set `use_user_db:true`and start.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! all docker images have now tuliprox under `/app`
- !BREAKING CHANGE! bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  is now `throttle` and supports units. Allowed units are `KB/s`,`MB/s`,`KiB/s`,`MiB/s`,`kbps`,`mbps`,`Mibps`.
  Default unit is `kbps`.
- !BREAKING_CHANGE!  `log` config `active_clients` renamed to `log_active_user`
- !BREAKING_CHANGE! `web_ui config` restructured and added `user_ui_enabled` attribute
```yaml
web_ui:
  enabled: true
  user_ui_enabled: true
  path:
  auth:
    enabled: true
    issuer: tuliprox
    secret: ef9ab256a8c0abe5de92c2e05ca92baa810472ab702ff1674e9248308ceeec92
    userfile: user.txt
```
- `grace_period_millis` default set to 300 milliseconds.
- `grace_period_timeout_secs` default set to 2 seconds.
- Fixed user grace period
- Added `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` to `reverse_proxy.stream` config. When grace_period granted,
  until the `default_grace_period_timeout_secs` elapses no grace_period is granted again.
- Added `method` attribute to input config. It can be set to `GET` or `POST`.
- Added optional `auto_epg` field to `input epg config` for auto-generating provider epg link.
- Added rate limiting per IP. The burst_size defines the initial number of available connections,
  while period_millis specifies the interval at which one connection is replenished.
  If behind a proxy `x-forwarded-for`, `x-real-ip` or `forwarded` should be set as header.
  The configuration below allows up to 10 connections initially and then replenishes 1 connection every 500 milliseconds.
```yaml
reverse_proxy:
  rate_limit:
    enabled: true
    period_millis: 500
    burst_size: 10
```
- Multi epg processing/optimization, auto guessing/assigning epg id's
- Fixed hls redirect url issue
- Added `force_redirect` to target config options. valid options are `live`, `vod`, `series`
```yaml
 options: {ignore_logo: false, share_live_streams: false, force_redirect: [vod, series]}
```

```yaml
epg:
  url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']
  smart_match:
    enabled: true
    fuzzy_matching: true
    match_threshold: 80
    best_match_threshold: 99
    name_prefix: !suffix "."
    name_prefix_separator: [':', '|', '-']
    strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]
    normalize_regex: '[^a-zA-Z0-9\-]'
```
`match_threshold`is optional and if not set 80.
`best_match_threshold` is optional and if not set 99.
`name_prefix` can be `ignore`, `suffix`, `prefix`. For `suffix` and `prefix` you need to define a concat string.
`strip :  ["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]`  this is the defualt
`normalize_regex: [^a-zA-Z0-9\-]`   is the default

```yaml
# single epg
url: 'https://localhost.com/epg.xml'
```
```yaml
# multi local file  epg
url: ['file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg.xml', 'file:///${env:TULIPROX_HOME}/epg2.xml']
```
```yaml
# multi url  epg
url: ['http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=1', 'http://localhost:3001/xmltv.php?epg_id=2']
```
- Added `strip` to input for auto epg matching, if not given `["3840p", "uhd", "fhd", "hd", "sd", "4k", "plus", "raw"]` is default
  When no matching epg_id is found, the display name is used to match a channel name. The given strings are stripped to get a better match.
- Fixed chno assignment issue
- Redirect Proxy provider cycle implemented (m3u playlist only cycles when output param `mask_redirect_url` is set).
- Reverse Proxy mode for user can now be a subset
  - `reverse`           -> all reverse
  - `reverse[live]`     -> only live reverse, vod and series redirect
  - `reverse[live,vod]` -> series redirect, others reverse
- `/status` api endpoint moved to  `/api/v1/status` for auth protection
- fixed multi provider VOD seek problem (provider cycle on seek request prevented playback)
- hdhomerun supports now basic auth like <http://user:password@ip:port/lineup.json>  
  you need to enable auth in config
```yaml
hdhomerun:
  enabled: true
  auth: true
  devices:
    - name: hdhr1
```
- A new filter field `caption` has been added. This field is used to bypass the `title/name` issue.
  If `caption` is provided, its value is read from `title` if available, otherwise from `name`.
  When setting `caption`, both `title` and `name` are updated.”
- Counter has now an attribute `padding`. Which fills the number like 001.
- Added proxy configuration for all outgoing requests in `config.yml`. supported http, https, socks5 proxies.
```yaml
proxy:
  url: socks5://192.168.1.6:8123
  username: uname  # <- optional basic auth
  password: secret # <- optional basic auth
```
- Added support for regular expression-based sequence sorting.
  You can now sort both groups and channels using custom regex sequences.
```yaml
sort:
  groups:
  order: asc
  sequence:
    - '^Freetv'
    - '^Shopping'
    - '^Entertainment'
    - '^Sunrise'
  channels:
    - field: caption
      group_pattern: '^Freetv'
      order: asc
      sequence:
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bUHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bFHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bHD\b'
        - '(?P<c1>.*?)\bSD\b'
```
In the example above, groups are sorted based on the specified sequence.
Channels within the `Freetv` group are first sorted by `quality` (as matched by the regex sequence), and then by the `captured prefix`.

To sort by specific parts of the content, use named capture groups such as `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, etc.
The numeric suffix indicates the priority: `c1` is evaluated first, followed by `c2`, and so on.

- Added ip check config
  - url # URL that may return both IPv4 and IPv6 in one response
  - url_ipv4 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv4
  - url_ipv6 # Dedicated URL to fetch only IPv6
  - pattern_ipv4 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv4
  - pattern_ipv6 # Optional regex pattern to extract IPv6

```yaml
ipcheck:
  url_ipv4: https://ipinfo.io/ip
```

# 2.2.5 (2025-03-27)
- fixed web ui playlist regexp search
- added `web_ui_path` to `config.yml`
- added grace period `grace_period_millis`  attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`
  If you have a provider or a user where the max_connection attribute is greater than 0,
  a grace period can be given during the switchover.
  If this period is set too short, it may result in access being denied in some cases.
  The default is 1000 milliseconds (1sec).
- added bandwidth `throttle_kbps` attribute for `reverse_proxy.stream` in  `config.yml`

| Resolution      |Framerate| Bitrate (kbps) | Quality     |
|-----------------|---------|----------------|-------------|
|480p (854x480)   |  30 fps | 819–2.457      | Low-Quality |
|720p (1280x720)  |  30 fps | 2.457–5.737    | HD-Streams  |
|1080p (1920x1080)|  30 fps | 5.737–12.288   | Full-HD     |
|4K (3840x2160)   |  30 fps | 20.480–49.152  | Ultra-HD    |

# 2.2.4 (2025-03-24)
- fixed `connect_timeout_secs:0` prevents connection initiation issue.
- fixed `hdhomerun` and `strm` config check for non-existing username.
- "Breaking CHANGE! Moved `connect_timeout_secs` is global timeout and defiend in config root and not `reverse_proxy.stream`.

# 2.2.3 (2025-03-23)
- variable resolving for config files now for all settings
- hls reverse proxy implemented
- dash redirect implemented (reverse proxy not supported)
- !BREAKING CHANGE! `channel_unavailable_file` is now under `custom_stream_response`,
- New custom streams `user_connections_exhausted` and `provider_connections_exhausted`added.
```yaml
custom_stream_response:
  channel_unavailable: /home/tuliprox/resources/channel_unavailable.ts
  user_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/user_connections_exhausted.ts
  provider_connections_exhausted: /home/tuliprox/resources/provider_connections_exhausted.ts
```
- input alias definition for same provider with same content but different credentials
```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
    - type: xtream
      name: my_provider
      url: 'http://provider.net'
      username: xyz
      password: secret1
      aliases:
        - name: my_provider_2
          url: 'http://provider.net'
          username: abcd
          password: secret2
  targets:
    - name: test
```
Input aliases can be defined as batches in csv files with `;` separator.
There are 2 batch input types  `xtream_batch` and `m3u_batch`.
`XtreamBatch`:

```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
    - type: xtream_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
  targets:
    - name: test
```

```csv
#name;username;password;url;max_connections;priority
my_provider_1;user1;password1;http://my_provider_1.com:80;1;0
my_provider_2;user2;password2;http://my_provider_2.com:8080;1;0
```

`M3uBatch`:
```yaml
- sources:
- inputs:
    - type: m3u_batch
      url: 'file:///home/tuliprox/config/my_provider_batch.csv'
  targets:
    - name: test
```

```csv
#url;max_connections;priority
http://my_provider_1.com:80/get_php?username=user1&password=password1;1;0
http://my_provider_2.com:8080/get_php?username=user2&password=password2;1;0
```
The Fields `max_connections` and `priority`are optional.
`max_connections`  will be set default to `1`. This is different from yaml config where the default is `0=unlimited`

- added two options to reverse proxy config `forced_retry_interval_secs` and `connect_timeout_secs`
  `forced_retry_interval_secs` forces every x seconds a reconnect to the provider,
  `connect_timeout_secs` tries only x seconds for connection, if not successfully starts a retry.

# 2.2.2 (2025-03-12)

      - type: xtream
        skip_live_direct_source: true,
        skip_video_direct_source: true,
      - type: m3u
      - type: strm
        directory: /tmp/kodi
      - type: hdhomerun
        username: hdhruser
        device: hdhr1
        use_output: xtream
